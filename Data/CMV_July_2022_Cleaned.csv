It would be dismissive to other non-white people or POC, because they are an other category with no distinctive identity within the BIPOC label. And exactly because of the particular type of American oppression of black people and indigenous people and because of the need to highlight these issues, there is no need to lump other non-white people in it. 

If talking about issues that  have to do with black and indigenous people, one could simply say black and indigenous people, instead of BIPOC. If talking about issues that have to do with non-white people in general, then one could use the POC label, instead of BIPOC. And if the issue is more nuanced than either option, then perhaps it should not fall under a label that could inadvertently simplify, confuse or obfuscate.

iei1ib3,1Random_User,"How do you want to define movement?

&amp;#x200B;

Let's try something broad, and you can tell me if you disagree: A movement is a loose association of people who have a goal of some social or political change and are actively trying to bring that goal about. 

&amp;#x200B;

If we want to talk about a movement we can talk about a consensus for what the people are trying to achieve. The problem with ""antiwork"" is that you basically have capitalists who are trying to achieve work reform, communists(and others) who are trying to replace normal work with being productive in local communities, and another set of communists who are looking for a (nearly)fully automated future with no real labor.

&amp;#x200B;

So you read through these posts and discussions and you hear competing communist theories and concepts, some of which are incompatible, and you hear them being mixed with capitalist ideas and concepts.

&amp;#x200B;

A movement doesn't need to be monolithic to be criticized, but there needs to be some consensus to call something a movement as opposed to just being a forum for discussion.  Within this forum you have two ""movements"" one trying to reform the capitalist system, and the other trying to enact some form of socialism/communism. While they may even both call themselves the same movement, it is sort of improper to conflate the two.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be like me saying the ""education reform"" movement and including both people who want to increase public funding as well as those who want school vouchers. They're both education reform, yes, but criticism against school vouchers wouldn't apply to those who simply want increased funding for schools.

---

&gt; But the antiwork movement will ultimately fail before achieving a ""work is optional and you can have a pleasant, safe, socially acceptable life without working"" world.

But you're assigning the end goal of the socialist arm of the forum (which also controls the forum itself, and therefore the stated goals of the forum) to everyone within in. I'd bet good money that -most- people on r/antiwork are not actual socialists with socialist goals, which is why describing it as a ""movement"" is weird, because I don't think most participants on the subreddit are actually there for the original purpose of the sub.

&amp;#x200B;

Labor reform as a movement has existed for a -very- long time and essentially embedded itself into the socialist sub (which is ironic because socialists often embed themselves into labor reform as well).

&amp;#x200B;

So 2 final thoughts:

A) I don't think your OP really captures the ""antiwork"" movement in an honest way, missing that most of the people posting about shitty bosses want labor reform and not socialism. Most of the people screen shotting their boss (i.e. the people you're complaining about) want better working conditions, not no work.

B) Your critique of the socialist goals falls short because your critique relies on capitalist assumptions of corporations and executives existing. Under anarcho-communism that wouldn't really be the case. Now, will anarcho-communism succeed in taking the nation by storm? Probably not, but issues like the people at the top of the hierarchy not understanding the problems of the little people or drops in production in a consumer economy aren't really problems in anarcho communism.

&amp;#x200B;

You're also making the assumption that the people with more information are acting in everyone's best interest. If the CEO gets a 50% raise but can't afford to give the janitor a raise and his best explanation is ""it's complicated"" it become -slightly- suspect that the CEO might have more information but isn't -really- making the best decisions for everyone involved.

In this survey like 50% of people were social democrar and 10% were centrist which are nominally NOT socialist or anarchist posisitions despite the sub being an anarchist sub. The mods are anarchist and support the goals youre talking about but theyre not a large majority of actual users. Thats why I said it has sort of become a conglomorate of ideologies rather than a movement. Generally soc dem is in line with the Nordic model of countries.

It is also worth noting that after the disastrous interview on fox a second sub ""workreform"" opened up formed by the labor reform folks in antiwkork and about a quarter the same size despite much less publicity and formed from much the same base.

I'm not sure what qualifies for a delta but I hope you keep an open mind to labor reform ideas even if they come from the antiwork label.",2022-07-01 09:43:50,2022-07-01 14:08:25
ieidegf,Kondrias,"Any type of training and mental refocusing of peoplesis brainwashing. Going to school to be a doctor with the intent to be able to do whatever you want to people and push your alternative medicine., and they are having you take courses about the ethics and compassion to patients and using evidence based methodology to care for people because your goal is to give them the best possible result. And you eventually give up your alternative crystal treatment beliefs and then begin fighting back HARD against those alternative treatments. That is brainwashing: the process of pressuring someone into adopting radically different beliefs by using systematic and often forcible means. It doesnt have to be forceful. But an academic curriculum is systematic. And the education pressured you into adopting radical different beliefs in order for you to pass. 

Basically brainwashing can be applied to a TON of things as a term. It is all just a matter of degrees. And it is not inherently something heinous or evil. 

If you consider humans to hold no value or right to life and have no problem killing. But are put through a process to systematically show you that, hey, that isnt okay or compassionate or considerate and here are all the problems why and it is done to you even semi-forcefully. To consider that, you shouldnt slit peoples throats. I dont think people would consider that to be a bad thing. A rehabilitative program in prison is brainwashing. Making you believe, you should NOT steal and harm other people. 

For example, In this instance of military, i would say they trained/conditioned/brainwashed you to be loyal to the military, be effective and capable at following orders from commanding officers, but also possess a level of agency and capacity to be capable of acting independently to not perpetuate failures through a system. (Effective chains or command etc.). There is Probably a better way to phrase it. The skills and things they teach and train you in when they are working to make someone into the most effective individual for the tasks they will need to accomplish. Which can involve developing new mindsets and habits and beliefs. Which is not inherently bad, is brain washing. 

I mean shit, someone working at Disneyland is getting brainwashed being there, buying into all things disney and disney stuff and disney products and merch and the whole cult of personality around it.

Even if high school debate, your objective isn't to change the perspective of the person you're debating against, which is often futile, its to persuade the audience.  And if the upvotes in those comment chains are any indicator, you won the audience.

Changing someone's perspective online as a faceless and anonymous commenter is just such an insurmountable task.  Even with everything going for you from being right to being articulate, you just don't have the trust to change any but the most open minds.

Plus, most of what you're citing aren't debates at all.  They are people taking to the internet to rant, or confirm their beliefs, or troll.  Its like complaining, ""I interjected myself into an echo chamber and nobody listened to my points""... Of course not.  As an anonymous faceless commenter you simply don't have the power to force people to actually engage with your ideas.  Even if the specific person you're debating is reading your comments thoroughly enough to take pot shots at any flaws they can find, it doesn't mean the rest of the audience will.

Apply this logic to swimming, cycling, boxing, etc and you'll understand that you can't devalue a formal, structured contest simply because there are informal or alternative versions of that activity that work differently.",2022-07-01 18:32:50,2022-07-01 18:32:50
ieiyz60,Tnspieler1012,"1. I believe it's been widely observed (as in this [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolved_(film)) ) that the norms of high school policy is not at all designed with the intention of mirroring the type of discourse norms/debates one should expect to encounter in public life. Rather, it's intended to cultivate inherently valuable patterns of valid reasoning and argument assessment that helps the student to more critically evaluate arguments for themselves, while also providing them with some public speaking skills. Moreover, Patricia Roberts-Miller, while discussing argumentation education more broadly, also makes the point that we teach students more idealized forms of reasoning not because we expect that this idealized world awaits our students, but so that students will demand that their elected representatives emulate these norms of reasoning and argumentation. Establishing an unachievable ideal (see Habermas's ""Ideal speech situation"") is then a means to helping people to identify when and how people are using faulty or unethical arguments or persuasive appeals.

I would agree that supplementing this normative focus with more diversified knowledge of how deliberation occurs across contexts and communities is crucial to helping one adapt to new audiences or figure out to proceed in messier argumentative situations. However, this doesn't signal an inherent fault in the taught norms themselves.

2. I take issue with your characterization of many of your examples as ""debate"". Lying for political purposes, or bad faith gish-galloping for example, are only operating within a debate in a very loose sense. A broader education in rhetoric broadly construed, may better account for how this language operates than thinking of these as part of a traditional argument genre like debate.

3. I'm curious what you mean by ""**lose**...debates"" in your final set of examples. First, because I would be careful of characterizing most argumentative situations as win/lose agonistic encounters. As I suggested before, I don't think high school debate ever claimed to be the ideal approach to all situations where disagreement is present (see Douglas Walton's list of types of dialogue). The general goal of most arguments should be knowledge-sharing and critique in which all interlocutors benefit (see Daniel H. Cohen's [tedx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTN9Nx8VYtk&amp;t=373s)).

Second, it seems like you didn't lose, so much as you reached an impasse with with people who had different epistemic foundations than yourself. That's fine. Sometimes you can then move into a discussion about epistemology/authority etc., but very often the means to persuasion are simply not available with those people, so you just have to call it a day. In those cases, debate hasn't failed, because debate wasn't entirely possible to begin with. Not everyone can be persuaded in a one-off encounter.

I will go so far as to say I think curricula and education can do much more to prepare students to better address the epistemic foundations for their reasoning, rather than assuming that everyone accepts, for example, scientific institutions. However, I think this is less a failure of things like high school debate instruction than a sign that they see their goal as prepping students to either engage in academic and juridical contexts or to make their representatives more accountable, than to dissuade their neighbors of conspiracy theories.",2022-07-01 18:34:58,2022-07-01 18:34:58
ieize7i,LucidLeviathan,"1) I'm a lawyer. Those techniques are useful in court. In court, judges don't let you get away with a lot of the ""dirty"" tactics that you describe. While oral arguments and hearings are an extremely formalized setting, they are still vitally important. 

2) The defense to a strawman or red herring is to point out the truth. This is easier done in in-person arguments. Unfortunately, most of our political discourse today is done through the media, which is committed to ""both-sides-ing"" everything. The problem is that the arbiter is not truly neutral in this debate. The only way to reduce strawmanning in politics is to reform the media. I'm not sure what that looks like. 

3) The discussion about the other rights that could be potentially lost with the *Dobbs* decision is *not* a slippery slope argument. Slippery slope arguments require that the warned dangers are not the direct logical outcome of something. In this case, with Justice Thomas broadcasting the intent to revisit decisions, it is no longer a mere slippery slope. It is a stated intention that they are criticizing. 

4) The Gish Gallop is a relatively new debate tactic, so ideal defenses haven't yet been defined.  Online, you can do it by breaking up and rebutting every single point with every single reply. That's what I do most often on here and why practically every post I make on CMV has numbered paragraphs. In person, you have to be assertive and insist that your opponent give you time to respond to one thing at a time. You will have to be rude. You will probably have to talk over them. Once somebody starts with the full-on verbal gish gallop talking over you, it is unlikely that their mind will be changed, so really, you are speaking to the audience, not to that person at that point. 

5) When somebody comes to a discussion unwilling to have their mind changed, it's not really a debate. It's not really even an argument. It's two people talking past each other. Conspiratorial thinkers cannot usually be reasoned with because they discount shared reality. In any argument, you have to have a certain number of shared axioms. You usually don't have those with conspiracists. You didn't lose that debate because there was no real debate. The same goes for your climate denial argument.

6) I'm a pretty new mod to CMV. I've been learning a lot in the last few weeks about why our rules are structured as they are. We have extensive rules in this sub to ensure actually productive debate. That means that, at least here, you can learn some pretty effective ways of persuading people. Good debate happens when two opposing parties enter with good faith and with a shared set of views about what is and isn't fair game. This sub strives to do that. (Note: We also have a rule where we don't moderate threads we discuss things in, so don't take any inaction on my part as an endorsement or opposition to a post.)",2022-07-01 18:38:37,2022-07-01 18:38:37

I'm not saying that. I'm saying that ""I was just following orders"" is a classic line used to excuse a person's participation in any number of atrocities. It was one of the main defences for the nazis. It is not a good defence.

My point is; your moral responsibility doesn't vanish once someone else is giving the orders. It is still you choosing and acting.

20%? so *one in five?*

A 1 in 5 chance is substantial enough for me to base my decision on it.

That's not what you said before, but okay

It's still a relevant chance. Choosing to join the military - as you have said - is a *choice to engage in all the military would call on you to do.* The likelihood is, for the purposes of the choice, irrelevant. If the chance exists, you're making a choice about it.

Therefore, a choice to join the military is a choice to see combat, even if you don't end up doing so. Anyone who joins up without being willing to see combat is compromising their morality or stupid.

Hence, determining whether or not you are okay with 'killing people you don't know because you're told to' is a valid metric for deciding to enter the military, and constitutes a moral decision.

---

Oh, you can keep your morals - but only if those morals permit the killing of strangers on the word of another. Otherwise, you're compromising into moral dissonance.

What you CANNOT do - categorically - is avoid the moral decision in the first place. You must choose, as soon as you apply, to make yourself willing to kill people, support others who are killing people, and be involved in further enabling the killing of people.

Oh, of course. if there was an Objective Morality then this wouldn't even be a conversation.

iek62dk,carbonetc,"&gt; I've also personally managed to lose several debates thanks to bad faith tactics.

&gt; some people can use bad faith tactics to win.

You keep talking about winners and losers. How do you determine that you've ""lost"" a debate? What is the criteria? Does a guy in a black and white striped shirt walk in an blow a whistle? Discourse isn't a sport. To approach it as one seems to me to be a perversion and debasement of discourse. I don't know the extent to which high schools treat their debate programs like sport (I haven't watched or participated, personally) and I can see the value of the format as a learning exercise, but I hope they're clear that what they're having students do is still a big departure from discourse.

Here's maybe a better heuristic to go by for whether you've ""won"" a conversation. If people who are highly educated in the subject, honest, operating in good faith, etc. think that you presented your case in a rigorous, fair, and accurate way, you've won. Note that your counterpart can also have won if they've achieved the same. And note that you've still won even if you've convinced no one. If you're operating in bad faith, using underhanded rhetorical tactics that you would hypocritically object to if they were used on you, trying to win points with gotchas, deploying obvious logical fallacies, etc. you've lost. Note that your counterpart can also have lost if they've done the same. And note that they've still lost even if they've convinced everyone.

You'll probably call this idealistic, but I'd call it the only thing deserving of being called discourse. If you're in it to ""win"" rather than to have accumulated and expressed deep understanding of something, then I'd say you're more concerned about power than about truth. That's not discourse. That's combat. If what you want to play at is combat, that's fine, just know that it's a different kind of activity. Politics is rarely ever discourse; politics is combat in a poorly-made discourse costume. We need to always make room in the world for pure discourse to also exist, because there will never be any shortage of combat. Discourse doesn't need to be ""fixed"" by lowering it into the mud. You're correct that in combat you're lucky if there are any rules of engagement at all. Agreeing to rules and then breaking them is just another valid tool in the toolbox where combat is concerned, because combat is about power.

I take it that you value discourse and want to be involved in discourse, but other people are dragging you into combat.

And vaccines as a whole have been developed, tested and used to protect people from disease for over 100 years. The logic that the Covid vaccine was rushed out based on a small amount of research assumes that neither the decades of experience with prior/on-going vaccine programs or the massive research behind them helped in producing the Covid vaccine. That's quite obviously false. Dozens of countries produce flu vaccines every year, the US creates a new one every 6 months and has done so since the 1940s.

You should be careful about what sources you trust to give you information, because if they did not acknowledge, in 2022, the publicly available lists of ingredients, they are misinformed themselves or attempting to misinform you. 

As for tromethamine, it's an ingredient designed to stabilize the vaccine so it stays better longer. It's a [common ingredient in other FDA-approved vaccines](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/13/world/what-is-tromethamine-tris.html), including vaccines given to children. Why should we assume it is dangerous?

You may not have a strong political bias, but I think your sources do. This has happened to people I love before - they see themselves as unbiased and seeking skepticism of accepted thought, but it ends up curating their informational feeds toward any skepticism at all, informed or uninformed. And there is a lot of uninformed skepticism about COVID-19.

iekz2z4,LucidMetal,"I'm not going to ""both sides"" this because I think that's a silly argument and the GOP is obviously at fault for the actual policies and political actions which are resulting in the decline of America BUT I think you're missing something key.

Th GOP isn't the *cause* of the decline. The GOP is merely a tool. It's a tool for dark money and incredibly wealthy people with nefarious goals (such as preventing action on climate change) to amp up social issues so that they can take advantage of the inherent weakness of the American electoral system, which is that our democratic republic gives extremely disproportionate voice to the least educated, most gullible subset of the population (rural voters).

I know there are some true believers in the ranks of the GOP who are absolutely, unabashedly stupid but many of them are just straight up lying. Mitch McConnel, Ted Cruz, and Newt Gingrich (might need to wiki this guy depending on your age but he was instrumental in creating the current adversarial political landscape) are clearly very intelligent individuals but they are just trying to make a buck and ensure their compatriots can continue making bucks to the detriment of the rest of society for decades to come.

iekzmdt,Phage0070,"Your claim is that there shouldn't be a stigma to the idea of incest.

But you argue against this by proposing only queer incest to dodge the inbreeding issue, and propose non-abusive incest despite that being what is most often heard about.

Homosexual incest is certainly a more rare situation than heterosexual incest. Why should a stigma not be formed when the vast majority of what people actually hear is heterosexual, abusive incest? Even if we completely agree that there is a morally acceptable form of incest that is possible I don't see how that forms an argument against a stigma.

---

&gt;	there’s a harmful stigma that needs to be eliminated from society concerning certain type of incest.

I think you are asking a bit much from a stigma. Even if there is some vanishing minority of incestuous relationships which are harmless it is too nuanced a view for stigma.

A stigma is inherently a generalization. If 99% of something has a certain negative trait they all will gain a stigma for the negative thing. Sure it is more accurate to consider each situation independently but it is precisely this effort that a stigma avoids. That is basically the whole point, to avoid needing to make an individual judgment per instance of something.",2022-07-02 02:41:49,2022-07-02 07:50:41
iel3x1r,rwhelser,"Only point I would argue here is the use of the term “democracy.” The U.S. was founded as a Constitutional Republic, not a Democracy. What’s the difference? In the Republic, power is in the hands of individual citizens. In a democratic system, laws are made by the majority. In the Republic system, laws are made by the elected representatives of the people. In a democracy, the will of the majority has the right to override the existing rights.

Additionally, the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

The founders did not trust a strong federal government, as they felt it would lead to a corrupt executive. And they just went through  a seven-year revolution to overthrow just that. I know you said don’t use the 10th Amendment, but that’s like saying tell me why it’s good to breathe oxygen but don’t talk about lungs. 

There are some issues to which it makes sense for states to have power. For example, minimum wage laws. How well does the legislature in DC understand how the cost of living is in Omaha, San Diego, Anchorage, or Buffalo?

When a crime is committed should the FBI be running point on how to deal with it? When schools in urban areas fail to achieve the success seen in the suburbs, is it Uncle Sam’s responsibility to fix them? Does Congress know better than the State or City Council? Should Uncle Sam decide which roads should be fixed and if so, how?

I think part of the problem with this kind of topic is the lack of understanding (or interest) in politics of the common American. Anyone can tell you who the President is, but do they know who their governor or mayor is? Do they know how state or local politics work? In my experience most say no.

---

Take a look at the examples I gave. Issues such as minimum wage, maintenance (such as roads), housing, and public assistance are all examples of policies that are much better handled at the state level compared to the federal level. 

Is it better to operate with only a federal minimum wage or is that better suited for the states? Or should every municipality out there conduct an economic analysis to determine what’s best for them (if you look at who is typically involved in local politics, and the way they operate, you might see why it’s better left to the state). If someone is seeking unemployment compensation or Medicaid benefits, should that be something Uncle Sam manages or should every city try to build up a massive budget to provide for that? Or are the states better off managing such programs. 

Often, states serve as policy testing grounds. Minimum wage, for example, was enacted at the state level before it became a federal law. More recently, the loosening of marijuana laws has been a state initiative even though Uncle Sam hasn’t followed suit (I suspect at some point in the not so distant future that will change). Gay marriage was a state level initiative until pushed to the federal level when DOMA was challenged in court (technically there’s no federal law out there saying gay marriage is illegal, in fact the opposite is what was struck down). Consider anything you need a license for. For example if every city had their own standard for driver’s licensing, would you prefer to have to get a license in every city you drive through in order be allowed to drive? Same for hunting and fishing licenses. Also keep in mind how much of a strain these issues would put on municipalities. You might think of a place like New York with a massive budget but consider some random township in the Midwest with a population of 50. 

With respect to your arguments about cities being shackled to the state, there have been instances where cities went against state and even federal policy. Take a look at sanctuary cities as a great example. Why don’t we see cities being more rebellious against state governments? Money. Same reason Uncle Sam can get states to fall in line. If a state goes against a federal policy one way to keep them in line is threatening to cut off federal funding (look at the covid vaccine debate for reserve and national guard members as an example). 

Fact of the matter is you can say you’re not interested in the constitutional argument but that’s the law of the land and it expressly gives power to the states. If you’re going to say I don’t care about the constitution argument then should it be on the cities to create/enforce constitutional rights because we don’t like one provision in the constitution? Should cities regulate their own free speech? Should cities form their own little militias, enact and enforce their own borders? Just keep in mind you can’t say “I don’t care about constitutional arguments” on one topic and then say you do on another. But I do understand where you were making your point. 

At the end of the day, there are policy issues best handled by Uncle Sam, and others best handled by state and local governments.

---

According to your own words, “to change my view, you need to show that states are better suited for the task of legislation than both federal and municipal governments….I am inquiring about what the best form of government is…”

Rereading the original post I see nothing about a moral argument. You asked for an argument to show states are better suited for the task of legislation and I provided a number of policy examples where they’re better suited. I also provided tested theory on how states are better suited to handle innovative policy issues before the federal government. If you’re going to simply change the parameters every time a response is given then you need either rethink your point here or accept that you’re not open to discussion on the topic.",2022-07-01 23:39:07,2022-07-02 08:22:32

I believe the US has been in decline and the US dollar will  likely lose its status as global reserve currency within my lifetime.

But the things you are leaving out to pin this on one political party as the primary source are telling. I scrolled through all the comments and didn’t see a single mention of COVID. Does this factor into your analysis? What about the crash of 2008? What about the culture war? What about the media’s economic incentives completely carving out the political middle? What about outsourcing jobs? What about foreign actors poisoning our social media discourse? You could say Republicans’ response to these things haven’t been ideal, but not that they caused these things or that total Democrat control would’ve resulted in perfect solutions to these issues.

Any phenomenon as large as “the global hegemonic power of the last half century is in decline” has thousands of causal factors. Republicans bad is just one of those.

For you it’s about acceptance and growth but it seems that for them the concept is about taking care of oneself mentally, physically, etc. When the idea of fostering such self-love became a popular talking point on the Internet, the way I saw people usually describe was more like self-care.

Consider manicures. We think of getting manicures as a beauty service but it’s also very hygienic as you safely clean and cut the fingernails.

Since we tend to take care of things we value, loving and caring for oneself in ways that involve anything from taking a mental health day to getting a manicure teaches us to not only value ourselves but also that we have value from the start.

I don’t think there is confusion, I just feel as though you have a different definition or understanding of what constitutes self-love.

The reason for the decision, from what I understand, is that the agency had to much power to interpret laws as it saw fit, which is the job of Congress (I haven't followed it closely because I'm sick of the radicalization). This does not match up with your statement about Republicans being Fascist because 1. This is *less* government control and 2. Fascist environmental policy was radically different than Republicans based on which country you were in. You should see what Nazi Animal Welfare laws were like.

Also about calling Republicans Fascist. This shows you don't know what Fascism is. Fascism regulates buisiness a lot more. It centers around an economic theory that rejects capitalism and socialism for class collaboration/corporatism (which is not big business controlling everything. That's corporatocracy. Corporatism forces buisiness to negotiate with labor. (Just a Warning: You're talking to someone who will use things like Doctrine of Fascism as sources if you try to argue this.) Decreasing regulation also is literally the opposite of any form of Fascism.

Now another point I need to point out:

If you read the constitution, Republicans are looking specifically what it says on the paper. They aren't caring about your feelings. Roe v Wade was overturned because it was legislating from the bench, which means you have a group of people appointed for life making the Rules. Democrats had decades to codify it into law but did nothing. If you want someone to blame, blame both sides since one side

So on to the decline

You defined it has reduction in quality of life. Find a place in the country, red or blue, that has not had reductions in the quality of life. Costs of living are skyrocketing. Gas prices are climbing. The homeless situation in some cities are out of hand. So is it necessarily Republicans fault or do both sides sit on their asses and blame the opposition?

Democrats with their affordable healthcare? Yeah you can qualify if you are so poor you can't eat and your quality of life is already shit. Throwing a bone to the poor for votes

Republicans standing around offering no solutions besides blaming Democrats? Sitting around doing nothing.

Why don't you blame all the senile, old politicians and the two party system? The reason America is like this: New ideas and third parties that actually bring alternate solutions are opposed to hell and back by the establishment so nothing gets done.

ielkv1k,HijacksMissiles,"&gt; Watching any amount of pornography has the ability to alter your sexual tastes to become deviant, leading you to pursue illegal content, which you may act on in real life. Those who watch illegal porn for the purpose of arousal, attraction, and sexual pleasure, are by definition pedophiles. Porn has the ability to turn people into pedophiles with a seemingly high likelihood.

That’s just correlation though?

You act as if pedophilia is a rare or uncommon thing. If you look back even a couple generations pedophilia was widely practiced. It was extremely common in many cultures across history.

This study assumes that porn _caused_ pedophilia in these people instead of _revealing_ it.

As other commenters have pointed out, they’ve seen pornography content for decades and not acquired pedophilic inclinations.

---

&gt; If your belief this correct that their true desire was just revealed, then why was it shown that 46% of users escalated to content that they previously found disgusting?

It is entirely possible people have been raised to provide a specific response to specific subjects without having ever been exposed to it.

It’s a similar phenomenon to homosexuals that are raised to hate homosexuality in religious/regressive areas, and they go so much of their life never really realizing their own sexuality, or hating themselves for the thoughts they may have when looking at members of the same sex. 

However, these same people when exposed to porn would _certainly_ end up gravitating towards homosexual porn. Even though they would have responded on the survey that it disgusts them.

It is entirely possible that this result here:
&gt; switching to a novel genre of explicit material (46.0%), use of materials that do not match sexual orientation (60.9%) and need to use more extreme (violent) material (32.0%) “

Is not a function of cause but simply exploratory self discovery.

Like. I’m approaching middle age. I’ve been around the block a time or two. Things that _actually_ disgusted me two decades ago still disgust me now. I can’t stomach the idea of even seeing some things, much less being sexually aroused by it. It’s difficult to imagine the things that arouse me just… changing.

And that study was done on polish students. Poland is in the midst of a similar conservative/religious societal movement as the US. Studies in areas with regressive and archaic views of human sexuality will likely be much more impactful than studies done in sexually liberated/progressive areas.",2022-07-02 09:59:05,2022-07-02 10:26:26
iell1kq,Crayshack,"I'm going to address Star Wars in particular.  In part because I'm very familiar with the fandom and in part, because I've written a rather lengthy article explaining the [difficulty in unifying the Star Wars fandom](https://crayshack.com/2021/07/07/star-wars-a-fandom-divided-against-itself/).

To summarize, Star Wars was fairly diverse in how the original film approached genres.  It was a blending of a large number of different genres that were all combined together in a unique fashion.  This was a big part of the initial success.  Fans of those various genres were all drawn in and felt as though they were getting a fresh entry in their genre.  This is a big part of why the original film was such a blockbuster smash hit.

The issue comes from later entries.  Because different groups of people had different aspects of the original film that drew them in and that they enjoyed, different groups of fans had different aspects they wanted to see later works explore in more detail.  The problem is that in some respects, to explore one aspect further means to neglect another.  So fans began getting upset when various details of Star Wars pulled away from what they saw as a core aspect of why they enjoyed the franchise in the first place.  

This wasn't helped by periods of time where Star Wars existed only as niche productions allowing different parts of the fanbase to focus just on the parts they liked.  When Star Wars returned to attempting big-budget blockbusters that attempted to recapture the magic of the original film, they found that the fanbase had diversified too much.  So, now the franchise is caught in a pickle where pretty much anything they release will be disliked by at least some of the fans.

TL;DR: Star Wars lacks a consistent theme present throughout the franchise as a whole so there are few people who actually enjoy the *whole* franchise and most people only actually like parts of it while disliking parts that follow other styles.",2022-07-02 10:27:47,2022-07-02 10:27:47

So yes, even if the political division in the US is comparable to that of before the Civil War, society at large is not. Most people are not psychologically capable of giving up Facebook; what makes you think they'd be willing to slum it in a milita? 

On a similar note, you describe this conflict being between the two major political parties; Republicans and Democrats. Lemme break down for you why you'll never see Dems and Reps actually fighting it out. 

i. Most Americans are not gun owners. Most Americans are very, very uncomfortable with guns, as well as violence in general. I do not think most Americans would be willing/able to participate in major violence. Yes, there are Conservatives who are clearly eager to based on Jan 6, but in that case it isn't a fight between political factions. It's a fight against a group of terrorists and law enforcement.

iii. On a similar note, most people are not actually loyal to the DNC/RNC anymore. In reality, most Americans are moderates, and most Americans generally dislike career politicians. It just *seems* like people are super partisan because the DNC/RNC are very good at maintaing control.

ielzx3b,MutinyIPO,"Going death by death feels impossibly crude, it’s just that I’m sick of seeing this “40+ deaths” stat, which is at best misleading and at worst active disinformation. 

First off, the *broadest* possible definition of deaths tied to the BLM unrest results in 19 deaths total, which isn’t nothing! But it’s not 40, and even then when you scrutinize these incidents they don’t appear to have much to do with BLM at all:

-May 27: Two people killed in Minneapolis during a pawn shop robbery happening under the cover of greater civil unrest

May 29: a protestor in Detroit was shot by someone in a vehicle outside the protest

May 29: Oakland CA, a security guard was killed in a drive-by shooting happening concurrently to the protests, though with no apparent connection to the protests themselves 

May 30: St Louis MO, a man robbing a FedEx truck was ran over by that truck (again, happening concurrently with protests, but with no clear link to the protest itself)

May 30: Omaha NE, a protestor was shot and killed by a bar owner afraid the protestors would threaten his property, although they had not done so

May 31: Kansas City MO, a man is shot and killed during a car robbery happening concurrently with the protests (are you noticing a pattern here?)

May 31: Chicago IL, a man is shot and killed during a convenience store robbery

June 1: Indianapolis IL, two people were shot and killed by a gunman, and I literally can’t find any more details than that

June 1: Louisville KY, a restaurant owner is shot and killed by the Louisville police after they violently enforced curfew at a neighborhood gathering, and someone lost in the chaos fired a shot. 

For the above incident, it’s unclear who fired what when, but hours after the incident, the Police chief was fired with cause. This strongly suggests the police were the aggressors. 

June 1: Davenport IA, a protestor is attacked and killed on her way home

June 1, Davenport IA, a man is shot and killed after shooting at an unmarked police van. This is perhaps the only incident that fits the moral panic narrative, and even then 1. The person who was killed was the one who attacked police, not an officer and 2. Once again, there is no clear link to BLM, it’s a concurrent event 

June 1, Cicero IL, two men are shot and killed during a liquor store looting/robbery. 

June 1, Las Vegas NV, a concealed carrying man in a “rowdy” gathering is shot at by a police officer, he returns fire, flees and is eventually shot dead by police

June 2: Philadelphia PA, across the city, two different men are killed while trying to rob stores 

June 2: St Louis MO, this is the famous David Dorn case. I’m not gonna lie, it’s horrifying. There is still no apparent connection to BPM. 

June 2: Vallejo CA, an unarmed man is shot and killed by police while kneeling

June 3: Bakersfield CA, a protestor is run over by a car

June 20: Seattle, WA, someone sleeping in CHAZ is shot and killed. Unclear circumstances leading up to the incident, although we know that other CHAZ residents rushed the victim to the ER directly after they were shot. 

June 29: Seattle WA, another CHOP/CHAZ shooting, again extremely unclear what happened 

July 4: Seattle WA, a protestor is murdered in a hit and run on the highway 

July 5: Indianapolis IN, a woman is killed during a drunken brawl that was apparently triggered when she said “All Lives Matter”. This is kinda-sorta a BLM link, but not *really*. Like - bar brawls tend to happen over absolutely random shit, especially when someone says something inflammatory. The incident is still tragic of course, it’s just that yet again the connection to protests here is tenuous at best. 

July 25: Austin TX, a protestor is run over in an apparent hit and run

August 29, Portland OR - yet another highly publicized incident, in which an anti fascist assassinated a member of a far-right militia. Probably one of the two incidents that fits the broad criteria. He was killed by US Marshals shortly thereafter. 

So as you can see, there was precisely one verifiable incident of a politically-motivated killing, and it happened after the protests/riots had been raging for months. The FAR more reliable patterns here were 1. *BLM protestors* getting killed and 2. Burglars using the protests as cover to do their thing",2022-07-02 12:17:41,2022-07-02 12:17:41
iem2b2b,EarballsOfMemeland,"&gt; However, Defund the Police wasn't around in 2016 when Trump got elected. At the time, the biggest buzzword on the left was ""privilege."" Specifically, ""White Privilege"" and ""Male Privilege.""

&gt; These are horrible terms. Arguably the worst terms that you could have chosen to convey the meaning, for many reasons. First of all, the word ""privilege"" has historically been assigned to rich kids that have never had to work a day in their life. Who are completely out of touch with the real world because they've never had to participate in the real world. It has, historically, been a pejorative.

&gt; Assigning this term to the inherent advantages that some men and white people receive based on their skin color or gender was a huge marketing mistake. It automatically puts those groups on the defensive. They feel like people using those terms think that they've had an easy life of abundance and have never worked for a thing they've gotten. That what little they've managed to build was handed to them instead of earned.

Well by your own definition of the term privilege, the term is being used correctly in both White privilege and Male privilege. If a wealthy person is privileged because they have never had to work a day in their lives, ie walked in the shoes of those who have to say work on factory floors or dead end 9-5's, then a white person has never had to live as a POC, or a man never having to live as a woman and deal with women's issues (with the exception of men who have transitioned). If using correct terminology upsets people to the point of radicalisation then I'm not sure what to say. 

&gt; Pop Culture and Hollywood

Again, if Ghostbusters and Star Wars radicalise moderate men, I doubt they were that moderate. This section reeks of cherry picking, for every movie you mentioned as being overly feminist there's half a dozen more with stereotypically manly men do manly men things. Movies like Ghostbusters were cherry picked intentionally pushed by the right as part of the culture war. And it's not like men as a villain is new, it's been going on since the dawn of cinema. Was the original Star Wars trilogy pushing an anti-male, anti-white narrative? Or how about Death Wish, Commando, Die Hard any number of movies. Of course not, because figures on the right want to push the culture war.

&gt; Dismissal of Men's Issues.

Some of these points are valid. Yes, men's issues like high suicide rates absolutely deserve attention. But: 

&gt; However, when men tried to bring up these issues, they were basically told to shut up and sit down.

By other men and by people who valued traditional masculinity. Not the left. You're saying that moderate men were radicalised in to supporting the parties that create the environments that support the Moderate Men's own oppression. I do agree with some other points here, yes there is a level of hypocrisy in body positivity, but again, the right does not even claim to try to make things better for men. They will say ""Well since men can still be made fun of for our bodies, we're not going to subscribe to any sort of boy positivity"", when obviously the better way of thinking is to fight for body positivity among men too. 

&gt; Tinder and Dating

This section really doesn't seem attached to reality. Millions of men across the world don't have trouble finding partners. If some do, it's on them, not society or women, or whatever else. We're seeing a rise of red pill groups because people don't like being told that things are their fault, and grifters, of both monetary and political varieties, caught on to that and preyed upon those they saw as vulnerable. The Taliban also use the promise of women in addition to money to recruit new fighters. Are they Left wing?",2022-07-02 12:36:15,2022-07-02 12:36:15

iem3slt,lydiansharp1,"I'm gonna address the men's rights stuff, seeing as how I'm a man who somehow magically isn't being ""pushed to the right"".

&gt; Men's issues have always existed, from suicide rates, to bias in the justice system and family courts. However, when men tried to bring up these issues, they were basically told to shut up and sit down.

I haven't seen this. I've seen men try to *shut down* feminists asking for equal rights by saying ""but what about these issues that affect men???""

What I have also seen is that men who talk about their mental health issues, about feeling depressed, about just basically having emotions, tend to get shut down *by other men*, especially by conservatives. Example: I'm FTM, and there's this ""running joke"" with my conservative family members that whenever I show any sort of emotion that's proof that I'm really a woman. The left-wing people I interact with never say anything like that.

&gt; Then social media started allowing some hate speech, but not others. Hate speech directed at men or white people was blatantly allowed, while saying the same thing about women or POC would get you immediately banned. ""Kill All Men,"" ""Male Tears,"" etc, etc. Change those terms into any other demographic, and that would be hate speech.

Weird, because every time I've seen someone say ""kill all men"" on social media it gets taken down super fast.

&gt; When men spike out about these things, they were again told to go eff themselves. Even this very site did similar things. r/twoxchromosomes spews just as vile things about men as r/mra spewed about women. One was removed from the platform, the other is still alive and well today.

Literally what vile things are being spewed on r/twoxchromosomes? I'm looking at it right now and it's mostly people talking about abortion rights and violence against women. Linked examples would be appreciated.

&gt; Body positivity is another example. Women were 'all beautiful' no matter their size, while men were still openly mocked for everything from their height, penis size, or weight.

No, that's not cool.

So what are you doing about it? Are you just sitting there expecting women to start some kind of All Men Are Beautiful movement? Or are you calling out the people who say gross things like that? (It's both men and women who do that shit, in my own experience.)

Just a little protip, the main impediment of the male body positivity movement that I've personally witnessed has been the people who hijack it to whine about how women have it so much easier. And that tends to be the problem with most pro-men movements. Like, quit talking about women if what you really want to do is promote men's issues!

&gt; Articles started popping up online about ""Men are going to college less, and women are the most affected."" Basically saying that undereducated men was actually a women's issue because that meant less eligible men for women to date.

I've literally never seen anything like this, where are you seeing this?",2022-07-02 12:47:46,2022-07-02 12:47:46
iem5cyi,I_am_the_night,"So, for you or anyone else thinking of crypto or NFTs in a positive light, I cannot recommend enough the YouTube video [the Line Goes Up](https://youtu.be/YQ_xWvX1n9g).  It's an extremely thorough breakdown of the very fundamental problems in the crypto and NFT marketplaces/cultures/worlds.

Basically, crypto never has been and never will be anything other than a speculative financial investment.  The way that it is organized also disproportionately rewards the dishonest and those already holding substantial capital. Crypto is also terrible for the environment, and terrible for like 99% of people who try it. The market places and exchanges are filled with scams, and have essentially zero consumer protections.

If you didn't already get rich off of crypto, you are probably more likely to get some return from the lottery at this point, unless you are already knowledgeable enough of financial dealings that you could make money elsewhere.

Or a dry state ( if there was one) or a reservation, or on sundays in areas with blue laws, or till a certain time of day in other areas.

You should look at Oregon's model, we had just as much of an established black or grey market as California, and it has pretty much disappeared.

The federal government should de schedule and decriminalize cannabis, but the specifics of legalization should be left to the states. 

A federal system is likely to be more money grabbing and corporate controlled than the systems already in place in more functional states

---

Every state with a recreational system still allows local counties and municipalities to opt out of sales, much like with the sale of alcohol and dry counties.

Its still not illegal to own and no one is being persecuted.

Federal decriminalization and descheduling would do much of the same.

Federal legalization, on the other hand, will be influenced by insidious lobbying groups like the National Cannabis Roundtable, and thus will pursue the worst possible models of legalization.

You should look into the system in Oregon, we had a very similar illicit market to California prior to recreational legalization, but we introduced far less restrictive taxes and fees.

iemrf39,distractonaut,"Ok so first of all, I'm not autistic but I work as a speech therapist &amp; behaviour therapist at an autism-specific organisation. So, I'll share some of the reasons I've heard from people in the autistic community about why they don't like the term. I don't necessarily want to change your personal feelings about the term (you do you) but will just share some perspective.


1. I think a lot of people don't interpret the term 'highly functioning' to mean 'a highly functioning member of society',  but more 'highly functioning... for an autistic person'. So, the default expectation is that they *wouldn't* be 'functioning' well, so you need to label it if the person can actually live independently, have a job etc. I can see how this could be considered offensive, in a similar way to how describing a Black person as ['articulate'](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theroot.com/he-s-so-articulate-what-that-really-means-1790874985/amp) might be considered offensive.


2. Some of what you've described around studying facial expressions and learning to socialise - I have heard this be described as [masking](https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/autism-masking#definition) which some in the community feel is kind of artificially forcing themselves to 'conform' to neurotypical expectations. I've read and heard a lot of perspectives of autistic people saying that they feel like they have to 'hide' their true selves to be accepted, and sometimes even to avoid discrimination or bullying.


3. The main reason we've stopped using the terms 'high functioning' and 'low functioning' at my organisation is that it really doesn't help much in terms of actually describing the person, their strengths and challenges. If someone is described as 'high functioning', people might assume that they don't ever struggle or need any supports when actuality they might be working really hard and under a lot of stress all the time. Or, be able to live and work independently but still struggle with social cues or sensory regulation. And 'low functioning' might invite people to assume the person can't ever learn independent skills or be a functioning member of society, when really they just haven't been offered the right type of supports yet.",2022-07-02 15:52:55,2022-07-02 15:52:55
iemtkbq,Guy_with_Numbers,"&gt; My reasoning for taking this stance is that I have manually learned all I know about socializing, something most people learn naturally while growing up. I've studied the people around me extensively, watched media (both fictional and reality) for hours on end to recognize patterns in speech and socializing. I've actively listened in on, and participated in conversations throughout my life, even though the most common reaction the first ten years was the others leaving because of something I said/didn't say or because I looked bored/uninterested. I've studied facial movements, expressions, and have had to manually manufacture my own expressions of varying emotions. At this point it's 85% automatic since I've been doing it for so long. However, I feel like becoming a ""Highly Functioning"" member of society is something we should all strive for, and therefore I am proud that I am classified as one considering the inherent disadvantages that stand in my way of doing just that.

I think you're following a somewhat different idea of ""high functioning"" than what that term entails. [The ""high functioning""](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/high-functioning-autism) is relative to someone with more severe symptoms of autism. That isn't something that we all have to strive for, because non-autistic people are the ""fully functioning"" benchmark already. That isn't even necessarily something that *can* be striven for either, as not all autism symptoms can be mitigated to such an extent through personal effort.

In addition, while your pride in mitigating your symptoms through your effort is entirely valid, that is something highly specific to you. Other people may see things differently. If I see someone with amputated legs swimming and I say, ""You're a pretty good swimmer for a legless dude"", some will see it as a compliment directed at their skill, and others will see it as a reminder of their shortcoming and how their achievements are qualified by that shortcoming. Likewise, you see the term as praise for your efforts, but others may see it as a reminder that they are not ""normal"".

Given that the positive connotation in both those scenarios (good swimmer/good social skills) can be conveyed without using a term that can potentially be perceived negatively (amputee/autistic), I'd say ""high functioning autist"" isn't a flattering term.",2022-07-02 16:09:16,2022-07-02 16:09:16
iemytgv,budlejari,"High functioning is not used when comparing autistic people to neurotypical people. It's always used as a comparison to 'low functioning' people. The 'stereotypical' autistic person. 

And high functioning is bad as a label because it does not convey what 'high functioning' means. Someone can be perfectly capable of sustaining something like a job, get home, and literally be unable to function because they are so overwhelmed and distressed by masking all day that they need help to do basic tasks like having a shower. They have to sleep to get over it, they have severe gastro issues because anxiety over masking, and they're unable to indulge in their passions because they're worried about coming across as abnormal. But they live in their own home, they pay taxes, and their boss thinks that they are 'normal' because they don't need to stim at work and they look normal enough to pass under the radar.

Someone else can headbang to self soothe, wear ear defenders when they go out because the world is too loud, and pathologically loathe metal cutlery so they'll only eat with plastic or their hands, but they're also capable of beautiful art and reading university level books on art theory. They don't work but they use their benefits to collect lego model kits that bring them immense joy and they're part of a regular Warhammer club that their dad drives them to twice a month. They have online friends, they do some side painting for their friend, and they're very happy in their own world. 

Which person is 'high functioning'? Which person deserves the label, if any? Does the fact that one person have a job mean they're 'higher functioning' than the other, even though it leaves them absolutely wrecked? The other person is on benefits, wears ear defenders in public, and can't stomach eating in a restaurant but they're  thriving in their own world, to their own standards, and they don't feel like they're missing out. 

Using labels like high functioning also diminished the idea of someone being autistic - it's suggesting that someone is so close as to be just like one of the 'normal people' so perhaps they don't need as much help or leeway as someone who is not at at that point or who chooses to *not* engage with society as a 'normal' person. Those people who use it as a term often use it as an excuse to disregard the autistic experience in the world and to assert the idea of there being different 'levels' of disabled and if you're not a particular way, you're not entitled to a kindness and tolerance for your disability because you are somehow *choosing* to not fit in. 

Low functioning implies that someone has 'failed to achieve' or that they are somehow lacking. It's often used to indicate someone who is profoundly disabled or who has a disability that is socially 'unacceptable'. They're not just 'weird' but in a quirky cool way, they are definitely Disabled with a capital D. Part of the difficulty with having children and adults with disability is that both they and their parents can be sensitive to the idea of 'not succeeding' being innate. It's easy to write off these people as 'not going to make it' by both professionals and parents, and those people can be disadvantaged by the idea that they're 'low functioning'. Just because they may not achieve total independence and will need support does not mean they will never do things on their own, have vibrant and passionate interests, or be an active part of a community, their family, and a wider society. Professionals and parents need to work together to understand the situation and to have reasonable expectations but assigning someone as low functioning effectively says, ""not going to thrive and achieve - don't even try."" 

Autism is not a one size fits all diagnosis. It's not a universal experience. Someone can have little difficulty in one aspect of their life but immense difficulty in another, and their level of need can fluctuate day to day, even year to year, or person to person. Putting people in boxes based on what they are 'percieved' to be capable of by using terms like high and low functioning does a disservice to everybody around them and the person themselves.",2022-07-02 16:51:46,2022-07-02 16:51:46

You want a real mental workout? (This will only work if you're  introspective and a little bit argumentative, but it sounds like you are both). Get with someone who holds the SAME views as you. Hearing your own ideas in someone else's mouth can cause you to think about them differently.  
""Do I really sound like that when I say X?"" 
""They're not actually justifying X very well. Can I justify X?"" 
Or even ""Dang! That's a good point! Why didn't I think of that to justify X?"" 

Sometimes hearing our own opinions echoed back to us makes us question those opinions; sometimes it gives us a deeper understanding of them. Either way, though, you're thinking, which is the goal.

ieoxt24,Scarecrow1779,"Your mindset reminds me of my own when I first got out of college. You assume all views are relatively equal in value and seek to moderate between them. Basically, you're saying, ""can't we all just get along?"" I maintained that approach through the 2016 election, and seeing the cascading results has absolutely disabused me of that world view.

The problem is, not all views are created equal. Some are held in good faith, while others are not. Some views are based on careful consideration, and some are not. Some people are willing to change their views based on discussion and new evidence, some are not. Some views may be misguided attempts to help others, while some views exist only for the purpose of selfishness at the expense of others. 

There is a common thread that ties together all of the negative aspects I just listed. They are fueled by a lack of empathy, respect, or consideration for others and perpetuated by a lack of critical thought or willingness to consider other views. Notice I did not say lack of *exposure* to other views, I said lack of willingness to consider. This doesn't have to mean that a person is inherently bad in their soul, per se. This can be driven by the opinions of those that surround them, the media they consume, etc. Specifically, the propaganda of Fox News and groups like it has been driven by fear, hate, lies, and dehumanization for decades, as a way to manipulate people for political and monetary gain. 

So, getting back around to my point: outside of politics and religion, views can often be discussed without vitriol and growth can happen organically. However, those two specific topics are where people are most often indoctrinated and manipulated by large groups to where the individual cannot consider other opinions. While at work, these topics can pushed into the background or ignored sometimes. However, in the context of a romantic partnership, there is no getting around or away from a person's political views, and they absolutely WILL effect the partnership when they are large differences in views. 

Think about all the things that couples have to consider together. Where will we live (so which state laws do we want to be subject to)? How do we raise potential children? How do we deal with medical issues such as unplanned pregnancy, planned pregnancy with complications, etc? How do we interact with friends of different races, beliefs, and orientations? If we have spare income, do we want to donate it to some charitable cause? Many of these things make politics inescapable and can deadlock normal conversations in a relationship if differences in views are too great.

So, the sum of all this is that some people's political opinions are too ingrained and negative to be ignored or worked around by their partners, and we have also shown many issues where a couple HAS to be in agreement for their relationship to continue. Therefore, it is reasonable to end or avoid beginning a relationship with somebody that has substantially different political beliefs than you.",2022-07-03 06:02:51,2022-07-03 06:02:51

iepg5cn,drogian,"Yes, but the first step to ""make [gifted programs] better"" isn't actually to build learning in a particular subject area.

Where I think gifted education fails is that serving a gifted student requires a two-step process:

* Reduce redundancy

* Provide opportunity

Education programs tend to skip step #1 and jump directly to step #2. But the mental health issues associated with giftedness tend to not be caused by a lack of opportunity to learn; gifted students (like many other students) will learn independently if the learning isn't forced in the classroom. The greatest need gifted students have is to not be browbeaten with busy work on a daily basis, leading to a sense of futility, purposelessness, and low self-esteem.

The first step in a gifted program should be to find ways to reduce redundancy the student faces. In a pull-out gifted program, this means that the gifted program needs to go into the regular classroom and reduce the amount of *work* the student is asked to complete to create and demonstrate learning in the regular classroom. As a second step, the gifted student can be presented with opportunities to learn that aren't just adding to a workload, which can include learning in small groups with similar peers--but this needs to be a second step (and sometimes similar-level peers don't exist).

This actually requires a paradigm shift. It's hard for people to realize that a good gifted program prioritizes *doing less*. But that's what's needed for gifted students. The first step is to empower those students to *do less*. The second step is to empower those students to use their newly-freed time to continue growing.

My point here is that, while you're right that gifted programs need to improve, the first step isn't to push students to develop additional learning in a particular subject area. The first step is to change the expectations for the students to respect what they've already learned. This provides what is sorely missing from many parts of the education system: respect for the student as an individual with unique needs.

The challenge is that many teachers of gifted students think they're respecting the student by treating the gifted student how the teacher would like to be treated in a classroom. The teacher confuses a *gifted* learner with a *mature* learner.

Most people who I've seen teach in gifted classrooms realize that the kids are smart, but actually underestimate how smart the kids truly are. People in general have a hard time realizing when someone is smarter than themselves, so it can be hard for a teacher of gifted students to realize that even though there is an age gap, the student is actually smarter than the teacher. This doesn't mean that the student already had content-area knowledge or understanding; the student being smarter than the teacher just means the student can pick up new ideas faster than the teacher can. But the teacher instead thinks the student is more mature than their peers.

Due to this disconnect, teachers in gifted environments often teach how they would like to be taught, with multiple repetitions in variously accessible contexts for diverse learning styles. But the kids don't need that; they can catch on more quickly.

So reduce redundancy.",2022-07-03 08:30:00,2022-07-03 08:30:00
iepi0u9,Manny_Kant,"&gt;If they are unable to be rehabilitated, that process simply doesn’t end during their natural life.

I think you're assuming many things without really appreciating their difficulty.  First, who determines when rehabilitation has succeeded?  There are plenty of examples of people [faking rehabilitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Kemper).  But there are also many examples going in the other direction, where people are kept long beyond what is appropriate, which is part of why we no longer have asylums.  

But there's a greater issue in the quoted text, and that's how to handle situations where the time called for pursuant to punishment is significantly different than the time needed for rehabilitation.  Let's say someone commits a minor violent crime, e.g., groping someone in public, because of a mental health disorder (most common reason for most crimes that happen in public, frankly).  Let's say that they have limited inhibition because of a serious but unmedicated schizotypal disorder.  This person has an intractable mental health condition that is unlikely to resolve in any significant way without medication, but they are also resistant to medication because it takes a significant toll on their perceived clarity of thought, and mood.  This person would usually be sentenced to some jail time, usually well under a year throughout the US, assuming it's charged as a misdemeanor.  But they are unlikely to be ""rehabilitated"" in that time, and any rehabilitation they experience is going to end as soon as they leave the facility and stop taking medication.  They may live to grope another day.

Under your suggestion, we would just keep this person in custody for the rest of their lives, right?  But this is where the ""justice"" system takes into account what is ""just"", which involves consideration of proportionality, irrespective of rehabilitation.  There needs to be a limit on punishments for certain crimes, which is why most crimes have statutory maximums, rather than extending to life across the board.  I think there's a value and wisdom in that, disconnected from any rehabilitative consideration, that you're not giving enough credit.

ieq314h,animatorgeek,"I think you're giving short shrift to the idea of bodily autonomy. In US law there is never ever a case where a person is required to sacrifice their body for the sake of another person. You have a rare blood type that will save someone's life? The state can't force you to donate blood.  Your minor child needs a kidney and you're the only viable donor? Not without your consent.

Even if we see a fetus as fully human with inalienable rights, to outlaw abortion is to give rights to that fetus that no other human has -- the right to use another person's body to stay alive. It's telling the mother that she doesn't have dominion over her own body, which is antithetical to fundamental principles of a free society. So outlawing abortion doesn't just make a fetus have equal rights to other humans -- it gives the fetus *special* rights that no one else has, to the potential detriment of its mother.

Honestly, that clinches the argument for me. It's not a complex moral issue, at least as far as how to write laws about it. The ability to end a pregnancy is a basic human right. Each pregnant person can make personal decisions about whether they feel it's right or wrong. It's not the state's place to make that decision for them. That's what ""pro choice"" means.

As far as ""we should talk about it more,"" I agree with what many others have said. The talking should be done between the pregnant person and their trusted confidants and medical providers.

You pretty much just decided that the latter would *never happen anyways* because of the Westermarck effect, which is clearly not true given that it is already happening anyways in real life.

And if you normalize that, you are also *aready normalizing* a 25 year old woman sleeping with her 45 year old father, as not really being more weird than any other couple with the same age gap doing it as long as they are careful.

This is not even a slippery slope. The only argument against these sex acts, is that they are wrong because we decided that incest is categorically wrong, even in edge cases that's direct harm can't be demonstrated, because they promote a *broadly harmful* view on families.

And this applies to two sisters as much as to a hypothetical ideal father-daughter couple, but you can't just lift it for the former and hope that the latter never gets brought up.

---

&gt;I’m not sure how far the Westernmarck Effect even extends considering how common cousin marriage was throughout history.

The Westermarck Effect has nothing to do with distance of genetic relationship, it kicks in from growing up together.

Stepsiblings also have a westermarck effect.

So would cousins who were raised together in the same community. Most of those historical cousin marriages didn't happen because of sexual attraction, (and neither did most other marraiges in general), but because the heads of the household benefited from setting up endogamous matches for their young ones. (keeping the tribe together, striking an alliance with  a relative who would be otherwise growing to be too powerful as a rival, etc.).

---

In multiple posts now, you are making the mistake of thinking about biology from a pseudo-creationist perspective, as if it would have been designed by a consciousness to fulfill a coherent goal. 

Evolution is just a process by which genes that are good at reproducing themselves, are the most likely to reproduce themselves. 

For example, in nature, if a speciman in an already overpopulated species has genes that make it's offspring less reproductive, then that lineage will die off, outcompeted by other lineages that are more reproductive. *Even if that leads to the species stripping their resources bare and dying out. There is no conscious oversight* that saves species from driving themselves into extinction. 

Likewise, if being unattracted to your close tribe that you grew up with limits inbreeding (because *most people* that you grew up with are blood relatives *a lot of the time*) , then the instinctive pattern of being unattracted to those close t oyou, will spread, especially since there is no better alternative because we can't directly detect genetic relationship itself with our senses.

There is no conscious oversight that will write that gene in a way to specifically turn off when it comes to same-sex relatives, or adapted relatives, unless the ability to have sex with those relatives has a massive evolutionary advantage that makes that tweaked gene more quicly spreading.

---

&gt;What exactly does this mean?

You are talking about evolution as if it would have a purpose or goal that it cares about, as if it would be just another name for God designing life.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Evolution is driven by the best way to survive, that sounds like a pretty conscious goal to me wouldn’t you say?

No, it's not.

That's like saying that rivers are driven by a conscious will to flow downwards for as long as possible.

It seems true at a first glance, but it's not, it's just dumb gravity. If a river had to flow a few meters uphill over a watershed, just so that it can then flow hundreds of miles downward, it still won't *decide to go through with it for the long term benefit*, it would rather just stay there and be a lake. The water doesnt actually *care* about being a long flowing river.

Likewise, if a gene had a great opportunity to spread accross a cotinent for millions of years, but to do that first it would need to restrict it's own ability to spread to avoid overpopulation, it would rather just overpopulate anyways. There is no long term oversight, no wise creator God, just the dumb cause and effect of genes that are good at spreading, spreading.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We actually do though, we can smell our close blood relatives and even their scent itself sexually repels us: [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2705-close-family-smells-worse-than-a-stranger/](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2705-close-family-smells-worse-than-a-stranger/)

Actually none of your source is about conrasting *blood relatives* with *adopted relatives*, it is about contrasting relatives with strangers.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If they’re queer they wouldn’t be wired with the Westernmarck Effect in the first place, since just by virtue of being queer they’re already wired not to reproduce, they are not wired with a reproductive imperative like heterosexuals or even bisexuals are, hence why they’re gay in the first place. Thus, having a gene based purely on optimal reproductive rules sounds counterintuitive/productive for a homosexual.

If being gay would fulfill some sort of teleological purose of Not Reproducing, then gay people could just be asexual (that's also a good protection from STDs), or better yet, sterile (that's also a protection from a speciman getting impregnated against it's will).

After all infertility does exist already, and it is trivially easy for a genetic defect that causes infertility in some percentage of offspring, to spread, so that would already fill that niche.

---

&gt;If genes really have no stop-gap measure to prevent them from running rampant and out of control then explain why in all the billions of years life has existed on this planet no one species has managed to outbreed themselves into extinction?

There ARE animals that go extinct because they are breeding more quickly than they have resources for, all the time. It's just that whenever you can actually see that happen as a sudden cataclysmic event, you are much more likely to point at the scarce resources than at the animal ""overbreeding"", but it's the same issue from different directions.

The reason why you don't see it when the resources are stable, is exactly because the species is *already optimized* to breed as fast as it can consume resources, so it has already hit a plateau and *can't* breed faster.

But this also happens on a tiny scale all the time. every localized increase in insects, rats, birds, etc. that blows up when there is a sudden increase in a food source, and then disappears along with the food, is a small scale overbreeding followed by the extinction of thousands of genetic lineages becoming dead ends, you just don't have to think about it that way because the next time there is food other similar animals from outside will show up to fill the niche.

Basically I refuse to believe that anything biological happens for no reason and just because. There has to be a logical explanation for every scientific phenomena out there, otherwise it wouldn’t be science.

The problem is that there is no real phenomena that you think you are seeing .

*Rats don't practice carful family planning* to make sure that they will all have great, safe lives with lots of food, with gay rat uncles, and abstinent asexual rat ladies, and so on. It just doesn't happen.

If they find a pile of grain, they will breed litters as quickly as they can convert the food's energy into little rats, so that even if most of those get hunted down their numbers can keep growing, and if they run out of the grain pile, they all just turn on each other or scatter around and get hunted down by a predator that will use the energy from the surge of rats, to have more offspring.

If there is a small percentage of gay rats at all, (and note that homosexuality hasn't been observed in all animal species, just some), they are a triviality next to the hundredfold population booms and busts that are happening anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Sterility is not a neurological, biological wiring like sexual orientation is, it’s just a technical misplumbing issue and a bodily defect so it doesn’t count.

Why not?

Technical misplumbings are just as easy genetically code, than neurological misplumbings, so if your point is that not having kids is evolutionarily advantageous, then the one that is lso more reliably working for it's ""purpose"", should have replaced the other one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You would think that if it wasn’t a population mitigating technique such an evolutionarily useless trait would have long died out

There are many speculations about that, for example male homosexuality might be a side effect of a gene of a gene that also increases female fertility which is what makes the overall gene biologically advantageous (Note that in real life genes aren't neatly labeled each of them with exactly one ""purpose"".) Female homosexuality might be an entirely separate biologically unrelated issue with similar underlying causes.

There might also not be an *inherited gay gene* at all, but a spontaneous mutation where one allele determining sexual orientation has a high chance of flipping over into another form.  (For example Sickle-cell anemia has no direct evolutionary benefits, so it is a genetic trait that isn't really passed on, but it shows up from scratch over and over again.)

Also, note that you didn't answer your own question either. Admitting that the gene is ""directly evolutionary disadvantageous"" yet saying that it is ""good for the species"" doesn't actually explain the logical process of ***what would make the gene keep reproducing itself*** if it's not good at reproducing itself.

---

&gt;This is the most likely explanation for the lack of regulation in breeding that leads to an extinction of certain species. They lack the “gay/queer” gene as a mitigating measure so it’s absurdly easy for them to fall prey to their population growth outpacing the resources available.  


Except rats don't really ""go extinct"" as a species, either. Population clusters might boom and then starve, but afterwards there are usually enough survivors to be ready for the next boom. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I mean think about it, why haven’t humans or other mammals ever been in danger of overbreeding to the point of extinction? I bet the common element that prevents this overbreeding in the first place is that gay gene that developed in only certain species.  


For the same reasons why rats didn't.

 For thousands of years the average woman had a dozen kids, then most of those died from malnutrition and overcrowding-related illnesses before they could have their own dozen kids.  

After a few good harvests, our population immediately boomed because women were less starving and a bit more likely to stay alive through a pregnancy, then after a drought the population plummeted, but most of the time it just stagnated right at the rate that we were capable of sustaining. 

A small minority being gay, was a small blip on the radar compared to that. 

Family planning is a modern social invention, from a combination of effective birth control, feminism, and yes, openly living as gay is part of it too. 

It wasn't invented by evolution with a higher purpose, it is something that we had to invent ourselves. 

&gt;Why would it suddenly form in a DNA determined “XY” person then?

Because that's what genes do. Brothers and sisters inherit genes from the same parents, that form into different chromosomes. The same genes might end up having different physical outcomes in men and in women.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Because a neurological wiring isn’t a literal defect like a body plumbing issue is, it isn’t a deformity or a coding mistake on the part of the genetic formation, it’s just part of who the person is.

Your ""plumbing"" and your neurology can both be called ""defective"" if you want to make a value judgement about them, or be ""part of who you are"" if you want to be supportive. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Isn’t that just a genetic defect that causes a disease? Are you saying you believe non-heterosexual orientations are technically genetic defects?  


Sicle cell anemia is a defect because we don't like it, and homosexuality isn't a defect, because we do like it. There is no such thing as ""technically a genetic defect"", the difference between healthy and defective is a social construct. 

&gt;Well if that theory about it being related to or part of a gene that increases female fertility rings true then it probably continues to get propagated through her line.  


Yeah, but then we are back to the original tangent. If homosexuality was not designed by a conscious entity to ""keep the population in check"", but the random side effect of genes that increase fertility in some of their non-gay expressions, then there is no reason to assume that the Westermark effect wouldn't apply to them.",2022-07-02 04:33:55,2022-07-03 11:24:46

With regard to euthanasia, bodily autonomy means that the government can compel you to reduce harm to yourself. Your body is not being used for a person's benefit.

In both cases, the government is restricting what you can do with your body; but actively compelling you to donate your body to another is more invasive than preventing you from using your body as you see fit.

Someone who respects bodily autonomy with regard to euthanasia may also respect bodily autonomy with regard to drug use, seatbelt laws, public nudity, prostitution, etc. This is freedom to use your body as you wish so long as it doesn't interfere with others' abilities to use their bodies. This freedom extends to abortion under the understanding that a fetus has no right to life, while under the ""right to life"" view of abortion, this freedom doesn't extend to abortion, as abortion interferes with the fetus's body.

With abortion, the government is compelling you to provide life support to that fetus. You're compelled to donate your body parts to another individual. That's more extreme than not being allowed to use prescription medication without a doctor's note. 

Someone can be in favor of protecting bodily autonomy with respect to the invasiveness of abortion (saying the government cannot compel you to donate your body parts) while opposing bodily autonomy with respect to the invasiveness of euthanasia (saying the government can prevent you from harming yourself). In both of these cases, a person could be against self-harm.

And someone can be in favor of bodily autonomy with respect to euthanasia (the government cannot stop you from harming yourself) while being against bodily autonomy with respect to abortion (the government can force you to support another's life if you're the only one who can support them). In both of these cases, a person could be against harming others.

Abortion inherently is anti-harmful to the self; it protects the self from harm from pregnancy. Euthanasia is inherently harmful to the self; it kills the self. They have different bodily autonomy implications.",2022-07-03 14:44:10,2022-07-03 14:44:10

The reason for this goes back to the civil rights movement, where there were plenty of ""whites only"" establishments that refused to serve people of color.  There was even a [travel guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negro_Motorist_Green_Book) explicitly for black Americans outlining where they could go and where they could stay without getting embarrassed, stranded, or put in danger.

&gt;If a business refuses to serve some people, let social media take care of them. But they should still have the right to do that. Is there a viewpoint I am missing?

Here's the problem with this logic.  Do you honestly think in the era of Marjorie Taylor green and Donald Trump, that there would be serious financial repricussions for businesses in conservative areas who discrimated against LGBTQ, Muslims, or immigrants?   The reason why businesses decided to segregate in the first place was because it was a good business decision.  ""My racist white customer base would rather not dine, shop with, or share a bathroom with a colored person.  Making my establishment 'whites only' is a savvy business decision.""

a gun shop who openly and publicly said ""we do not sell to Muslims or Arabs"" would 100% wear it as a badge of honor and market themselves as such.

In large cities/ major metropolitan areas, this isn't as big of an issue, but in small towns or rural areas that only have one or two gas stations or grocery stores, then that would absolutely have an adverse affect on an unpopular minority population.

What will likely happen is generations of prudes will die out, and more and more people grow up in an environment/society that has nudist friendly communities.

It's certainly possible to have a democracy that's not incredibly 2-sided, and indeed most countries are like this, with the United States being an exception due to its electoral system entrenching a 2-party system and that system becoming a strong part of culture. And a multi-party system would improve this. But it's not practical to have a non-partisan democracy for the reasons stated above.

The best example of why actually comes from the United States – the Nebraska Legislature is officially non-partisan, and its members cannot officially represent a political party.

It's not just about the value of the unborn life--it's about the mother's choice to deal with the natural consequences of sexual intercourse. A pro-lifer may believe that a child in utero has some entitlement to the support of a woman's body because the woman voluntarily partcipated in the child's conception. I believe this is the same ethical justification that the State uses to justify garnering an absentee father's wages for child support: the fact that he doesn't want to pay for the child's expenses is irrelevant in the face of his responsibility to it.

iex034d,distractonaut,"&gt;I think most people can get behind this but there is a small problem here. And that's the fact that a woman has the ability to not only control if she wants to keep the child or not but also using the government to compel the father to pay a large amount of money for years. Considering there's pretty much only one way to procreate both parties in that act have to realize that there is a possibility their actions could result in a pregnancy. You may not want the pregnancy to happen or to become a parent but recreational sex is still sex, which can result in a pregnancy, when you consent to an adult activity you need a certain level of awareness and responsibility.

First of all, being pro-choice doesn't mean also believing gathers should be forced to pay child support. Those are two separate issues. 

Secondly, having to pay child support isn't an infringement on bodily autonomy the way having to birth a child is - a more apt comparison would be if the father was legally compelled to give blood every two months in case the kid needs it, and also be forced to donate any organs the kid needs at any point in your lifetime. 

&gt;Calling pregnancy a punishment for simply having fun is a terrible way to put it and shows a very self-centered mentality

That's not what people mean at all. It's about challenging the idea that women deserve to be forced to give birth, and that by choosing to have sex they forfeit any right to bodily autonomy. Society in general shames women for having and enjoying sex a lot more than men, and I've definitely seen the mentality of 'why should she get a free pass for being a slut, she should have consequences'.

Some of these values are good, some are neutral, many are bad or even horrific. To treat people equally is to ignore the differences in their choices, values and morality, and this is unjust.  


Sure, there are qualities to a person that are not their choice, and thus should not be a matter of judgement: like their skin colour, height, inborn intelligence etc. But it is still just to judge people on how they utilise the qualities they are given.

iexkk8z,beingsubmitted,"Equality is a great goal - it's just more complicated than all that.

Suppose I pay workers $0.10 for every apple they pick in my orchard. Some people may pick 100 apples, some may pick 200 apples, but if they all get $0.10 per apple, that would be equality - of a type. Now, maybe I can give everyone the same amount regardless of how many they pick. You pick 100 apples, and I pick 150, and we both get $10. A person might argue that's equality, except here You're making more per apple because you're picking less.

At issue here isn't whether equality is the goal, but which path best serves equality. It may not be cut and dry... If I got pick 150 apples, and you go pick 100 after me, you may actually be working harder than me, I got the low hanging fruit, and you have to get the harder to reach fruit. Here's where the ""equality of opportunity/outcome"" distinction starts to break down. Do we have the same opportunity because we're offered the same price per apple, or would we have the same opportunity if we could make the same amount of money with the same effort?  


When the ""equality of opportunity/outcome"" distinction comes out, it's typically to hand wave away a clear bias. ""Black people have the same opportunity, they just don't take advantage of it"". Statistically, a correlation needs a cause - it doesn't need a specific cause, but spurious correlations aren't correlations. If two groups have the same opportunity but different outcomes, it's because of an inherent different between the two groups.

I work in municipal government in a rural area of the Midwest. In my experience, small towns often desperately want to attract factories, prisons, Amazon distribution centers, and other means of making the town grow. People who own farmland in small towns are the rich people for that town, and maybe they want to stay that way and oppose growth? But in my experience they will happily sell to a developer at the first possible opportunity, and clear cut all those trees if they think they can make a buck off them.. It's honestly kind of gross how slavish small towns can be when they think they might get some growth. These sort of towns usually have been experiencing population decline for decades, and they are well aware that's a problem that will only get worse. They often have a lot of difficulty getting qualified people to work in the schools, water treatment plants, etc. because of the constant decline.

iey5ie9,Desu13,"But that is not ""feeding."" 

Fetuses do not eat.

Fetuses receive nutrients from what-was -once food, that the mother ate, digested, and processed into nutrients. The fetus then siphons the nutrients from the mothers blood stream. This is not ""feeding.""

Additionally, parental duties does not extend to enduring grievous injury for the sake of your child. 

No one is obligated to endure grievous injury against their will - as that would be torture.

So you are patently wrong. Pregnancy is not like feeding, and no parental obligations towards the fetus, exist.

---

&gt;You can ""feed"" fuel to a fire. You can ""feed"" paper to a printer.  Youcan ""feed"" good ideas to a group.  Feeding has more than one definitionand isn't relegated to eating. Don't be pedantic.

I am not being pedantic. When you said ""feed,"" you **specifically** referred to the parents duty to feed their child. I disproved your notion that pregnant people feed their fetuses, and that pregnant people have a parental obligation to care for their child. These claims are both patently false.

This is not being pedantic. You are attempting to make it appear as though it is pedantry, because you were proven wrong and you are now trying to save face.

&gt;Especially if you want someone else to accept your characterization of pregnancy as ""enduring grievous injury"".

This is not a ""characterization."" This is objective fact.

All successful pregnancies end in a [gaping wound, the size of a dinner plate](https://www.thebump.com/news/placenta-plate-birth-recovery-photo) in their uterus.

The fetus is usually about the size of a watermelon, so you are suggesting having a watermelon-sized objecting being shoved out of someone's genitals is not grievous harm.

If you had a gaping wound nearly a foot in diameter, your genitals ripped and torn from a watermelon-sized object being shoved in/out of you, I'm sure you'd consider that grievous harm.

Furthermore, it is your fundamental human right to protect yourself from harm. This includes lethal self defense.

Lethal self defense allows you to kill someone in order to protect yourself from a perceived threat, and [what could be possible grievous harm.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/10/1047.7)

And finally, [this is the legal definition of serious bodily injury:](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=21-USC-402227300-1668295524&amp;term_occur=4&amp;term_src=title:21:chapter:13:subchapter:I:part:D:section:841)

*(25) The term “serious bodily injury” means bodily injury which involves— (A) a substantial risk of death; (B) protracted and obvious disfigurement; or (C) protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.*

Please familiarize yourself with the words ""protracted loss"" and also ""disfigurement."" Protracted loss typically means ""seriously bodily harm that results in a diminished quality of life for a long period of time,"" and ""disfigurement"" includes scars. Practically all pregnancies end in scars - as stretch marks is scarring. Woman who get C-sections (I think it's around 40% of the US get C-sections) leave scars from their stomach and uterus being cut open. If the scarring in the uterus is bad enough, it could lead to serious complications and even death in their next pregnancy.

Pregnancy meets this definition since pregnancy itself lasts for nearly a year, and after giving birth, it typically takes around a month and a half of recovery time.

And finally, here is a peer-reviewed journal from a law professor that explains and proves - not only through argumentation, but also through legal precedent, in which rapists are charged with more serious crimes if they impregnate their victim. The justification for doing so, is because the government acknowledges that pregnancy constitutes grievous harm. The journal states:

*""In several jurisdictions in the United States, a rapist who causes his victim to become pregnant commits an aggravated sexual assault. Having committed an aggravated crime, he will be subjected to a longer prison sentence relative to his counterpart whose victim does not become pregnant consequent to the rape. The rapist who causes a woman to become pregnant will be treated as if he broke his victim’s leg, gave her severe head trauma, or shot her with a gun. That is, the victim’s pregnancy is treated the same as a broken bone, a concussion, or a gunshot wound. This intriguing result is the product of sexual assault statutes that provide that pregnancy is a “substantial bodily injury” that can aggravate a crime. These laws, which function to construct pregnancy as an injury, are interesting for many reasons, two of which this Article explores in depth.*

[https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&amp;context=faculty\_scholarship](https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&amp;context=faculty_scholarship)

So yes, absolutely. Pregnancy constitutes grievous harm. This is not an opinion, this is not a characterization. This is reality. And since EVERYONE is equal, and EVERYONE has the fundamental right to protect themselves from grievous harm, abortion in all situations is justified.

So you find no differences between going to a grocery store and buying food, cooking said food and serving it to your children ||| compared to eating food, digesting it and processioning it into nutrients, and then the fetus siphoning said nutrients from your blood stream.

You find no differences at all between both scenarios.

It's very strange (and concerning because this opinion of yours is not based in reality) that you find this to be exactly the same as parents feeding their children.

This is your unfounded opinion. I have proven how it's wrong. So please, make an argument that proves your opinion is true. Your reluctance to do so is very telling.

But gender assumes sex which is based on biology (on several factors), so being labelled as one gender can create issues due to having a mismatch - firing up a gender dysphoria.  


Point number 2: They would be denied because there is no inherent biological factor that makes someone ""truly an amputee"".

Body Identity Integrity Disorder or BIID is a real but understudied mental illness that is extremely distressing to the people who have it.  It is not ""identifying"" as disabled but typically that for some reason either due to a brain injury or something going wrong in their neurological development before birth, their brain's map of their body doesn't recognize part of their body *as* part of their body, so the body part feels like a foreign object, violating the body's ""integrity"".  You can provoke that feeling in neurotypical people in various ways &amp; it's extremely distressing.  There is some preliminary evidence that amputation of the body part does genuinely relieve that distress and allows them to live normal lives, though they then need to compensate for the physical disability caused by the surgery.  If you look through bioethics papers on BIID, you'll find that the consensus is shifting to advocate *for* rather than against surgery as BIID is resistant to all other treatments tried so far.

I can easily murder them and just tell people that they were going to steal from me. No it wouldn't be easy, and I would need to plan things out much more than that, but it wouldn't be terribly difficult either. You know any reasonably clever person could get away with it.

Maybe I get into a fight with my girlfriend, and in a fit of rage I murder her. I'm not a sociopath, I'm not particularly good at crime, and I'm pretty panicked. I call my lawyer.

You want laws that prevent crime, first and foremost. When crimes still occur, you want laws that enable the law enforcement system to address them fairly and effectively. A lot of keeping things fair and effective comes down to judging situations on a case-by-case basis, and laws that determine outcomes by saying ""this behavior is legal under these conditions"" only serve to take away the power to judge situations with added context.

I do not see how this does anything but reinforce my point.

I only began perusing Reddit regularly in the last 2 weeks or so, so I have no idea what the general political climate is here. I came from Facebook which, at least in my experience, has been very conservative in its user base.

---

Please correct me if I’m misunderstanding here, but Roe ruled that abortion was included under the first amendment right to privacy - in other words, making it an inalienable right. The recent ruling, while I agree that it did not outlaw abortion in any way, did reverse that decision and removed this one aspect of women’s first amendment rights.

I’m not saying that the decision outlawed abortion or anything, just that there is no more universal right to one, and as you said this decision is now up to states.

if2vpe7,PositionHairy,"At a fundamental level for a society to work you need some amount of inequality. Probably not as much as we have right now, but some. There are a lot of reasons for that but the fundamental one is that profit is one of the only tools available for driving people to particular kinds of labor. For example, society needs coal, but extracting coal is super dangerous, very unpleasant, and causes long term health problems. If you treat all labor as equivalent and pay people all the same money, nobody would choose this job, but society requires it to be done. 

Some people think of communism as everybody just picks their job and does what they are passionate about, but under that system there isn't anything to draw people to horrible but necessary work. Communism's actual solution to this problem is to assign people to their work. You have no choice, because people don't sacrifice themselves for the good of society. That's not only true of bad jobs it ends up being true of every job. Normally economics dictates how labor is distributed, but stripping economics out doesn't strip out the needs that economics drive in a complex society. If you start running short on food you must have more farmers. If economics doesn't push people to farm then the state has to, and the citizens can't be allowed to say no. If they can then you may end up with an essential job that doesn't get done. 

Every communist state becomes oppressive because it must be. Communism claims to be a system of equality but it actually ends up being oppressively unequal because it treats all labor as the same by rewarding all labor the same.",2022-07-06 07:42:22,2022-07-06 07:42:22

You hunted a deer so that the nice old lady next door could have a nice meal. You would directly know who you were helping by working, and that makes you feel good.

When you pull this nationwide, that's not the case anymore. Now you have to pick up the slack for unnamed strangers at the other side of the country who might need your assistance or might simply be too lazy to work.

if37xxb,Whaddup_B00sh,"Communism does not work this way. It simply can’t. Capitalism is the pursuit of growth. Somebody can have an idea, and build that idea up, grow it, and by doing so, afford other people the ability to make money with them. Yes, capitalism is flawed, I very much believe that corporatism and communism are distant cousins, but the benefit of capitalism is that there can be several different systems of control in different stages, and people can go from system to system, taking power away from one system forcing them to change.

Communism has a completely different goal, and that is to have the collective have common ownership of the means of collection. It’s a nice idea in theory. Even if we remove the part about how such a large systems means we only need a few evil people to make it evil, it is still not sufficient. The reason has to do with the one thing capitalism is good at: growth.

By nature, communistic system grow more slowly. Think of any massive business or government, and how long it takes them to act on issues. This is similar to why it takes communism to grow slowly. Who decides what needs to be innovated on? Where the money goes? The people? How would that work? In the US we hold a presidential election every 4 years. It takes months to campaign, and days if not weeks to tally up all the votes. Would every issue about funding be like that? No, it’s not scalable. So, we would need to promote people to make the decisions. What if people don’t agree with the decisions? Can we vote them out? This is one of the major flaws of communistic arguments, they never explain how it could work with 330 million people in the system. Communism works well in very small communities, just like a small business is much more agile than a massive corporation, but as it scales, it slows down and becomes inefficient. Capitalism on the other hand has much more decentralized areas of control, so different sized systems (businesses) can do different things, and ultimately net a larger rate or growth.

The reason why growth matters is because of population growth. Let’s say you have a pizza and cut it into 4 slices for 4 people. Then a fifth person comes. How can you ensure each person gets the same amount of pizza as before when there was 4? You need a bigger pizza. Capitalism is by no means perfect, but it is better at growing the size of the pie so people are more equal as more people are born and needing to participate in the system. Communism can’t keep up. Over time the system deteriorates because it can’t handle the population.

So what ends up happening? They decide a split. Lower class people stay very lower class and poor, upper class people get to reap the benefits of the whole. This is how China, North Korea, Cuba (to an extent, not as successful) operate(s/d). It’s the exact opposite of what people want. Class mobility shoots through the floor, once you are poor you stay poor. It’s impossible to expect somebody to become a doctor without some added benefit of becoming one. It’s not scalable.

---

Are humans inherently selfish, or is this perceived selfishness only a byproduct of living in a system that necessitates it?

It's true that all people have desires, but selfishness shouldn't be taken to be the same as self-interest. Every person is suggested to care for themselves because they're familiar with their own experiences; but, to care for others stems from the same reflections that is sufficient to say we should take care of ourselves. ""Sympathy,"" for Adam Smith, is reflective as is self interest. We feel self-interest for ourselves when we consider what is good for us, and we feel   ""other-interest,"" or sympathy, when we consider what is good for others. The reason why the self takes precedence isn't because the self is more valuable or important than others, but because we can only know what is good for others from *their* reaction. We're likely to know what is good with people we are familiar with, and so altruism in this case is elastic.

But, selfishness is condemned because it's more often than not illogical. If no one, either because we are too separated to understand each other, or because we're inherently selfish in this scenario, helped each other, then no one would be able to receive help when we need it. A society can exist in this scenario, but it's not a practical thing to will. Everyone needs help with something at some point in their life.

Would you do a less *because* you get paid less? That's unethical even in today's standard. 
Also, are you assuming that if a job is difficult, you get paid more? Or only if a job is difficult you get paid more? The former is false when we account for jobs that are difficult and don't get paid well. And the latter is false when we account for jobs that aren't difficult and do get paid well. The difficulty of a job doesn't determine your wage as does your employer (assuming they're the ones making a profit), and your employer is incentivized to pay you as little as possible in order to make a profit.

However, these scenarios you’re describing such as not lasting long usually come from women who aren’t having orgasms. How many men have an orgasm and then sex is just over. So while I don’t think unrealistic expectations of male sexuality are justified, how would you feel if whenever the girl had an orgasm that was it, sex is over and you’re not worth the time and effort it would take to get one back. Because for a lot of women THIS is the reality. Bear in mind the equivalent erogenous zone for women of the male penis is the clitoris, not the vagina, and most women cannot orgasm through penetration alone. Not excusing asshole women, because they are out there, but I know a lot of women don’t care about size or stamina if they are also getting an orgasm.

With regards to ACTUAL responsibility, men will never know the burden of being the one who can get pregnant. Men wear condoms sure, but they don’t have to take hormonal contraception that amongst many side effects include increased cancer and blood clot risk. Even the more minor side effects like acne and decreased sex drive can be difficult to deal with. You roll the dice on whether to take these pills or accidentally end up pregnant and either have an abortion (which is an exceptionally difficult thing to do emotionally and physically) or stay pregnant and surrender your very own body for nine months and risk numerous life-threatening complications only to have a child at the end that you may not ever have wanted.

if3yjs3,Cool-Organization908,"There are different kinds of love. Your love can be based on one or more of them. From compassionate, which has nothing to do with passion, to infatuation, which doesn’t usually last longer than a year or to two. When someone falls in love, they don’t differentiate between these often. But a relationship based on just passionate love is most of time dead after a few years. To your opinion, I disagree: a lot of love is not more than the passion at the start, people often learn afterwards that there was t much binding them. And say they fell out of love. 
Expectations also play a was role: if people want or expect to feel a certain way and don’t, then they conclude they fell out of love. What they mean is they don’t have the same feelings and what remains isn’t what they want. 
The love you’re talking about is called true love, combining the different kinds of love. The idea in these cases is that the passion dies away but there are other feelings that keep you together. This doesn’t mean only true love is “good” or valid. And it doesn’t invalidate other kinds of love.
But falling out of love is real and I’d say much more common than true love which results in both halves feeling committed to each other based on feelings of deep emotional love.

Many laws agree with you. Being drunk is not necessarily a state in which you cannot legally consent. Laws regarding drunk sex not being consent tend to require the person to be completely inebriated, practically unconscious. If you are drunk to the point where you can no longer consent (according to some law) you would be unable to kill someone or drive to begin with.

What about bounty hunters speciically pisses you off so much.

---

Cool that should  be enough to give an honest attempt at this question. 

I think you'r confusing cool and romanticized for moral and righteous. The fact is a lot of the coolest and most romanticized people in history and fiction are not good people by any measure of that word. 

People like Cad Bane and Bobba Fett represent the same thing that their more heroic counterparts like James Bond do. Absolute freedom 

Cause the cold hard truth is when you're one of the most skilled hunters in the galaxy, people leave you be. Everyone from the criminals like Jabba, the Empire like Vader and the rebels either actively don't interfere with you or make it a policy to fill your pockets. Essentially the appeal of Fett and Bane is the idea of being someone powerful enough to inspire enough fear that most people know better than to pick the fight at all. 

This appeals because most people in their day to day lives have no power. One word from the government, their parents, their boss, the police. That's all it takes to bring their world crumbling around their ears. To some degree it'd be amazing to be a truly free individual. 

There's also the fact that most prominent bounty hunters are absolute monsters that honed their craft. Cad Bane and Boba Fett aren't blessed with Force sensitivity. Theirs is the skill that comes from a lifetime dedicated to training and honing their skills until they are, in a word, flawless.  

Also most bounty hunters aren't that bad. Compared to the Galactic Empire most are practically saints. Most have some code of honor and rules they won't cross. For instance Fett does the job no take backs. It doesn't matter if his target offers to pay him 10x more; deal is sealed. Some hunters reneg on any deal that the specifics weren't correct (Like in the Mandalorian he refused to kill a child regardless of whatever deal he had prior). Compared to Jabba the slave owner, Vader the team and child killer and Sidious the Emperor their sins are drops in the bucket. You wanna be mad blame the Empire who literally set the system up this way. 

So yeah most people recognize Cad Bane is evil but they also recognize the skill and training necessary to reach his level while also slightlu envying all that give him. A true freedom and the ability to determine their own fates in a galaxy where every clone and soldier and citizen is but a tool in the system. In a way the bounty hunters are more free  than even Vader. That's not nothing to sneeze at. That's what's so cool and apealing",2022-07-06 14:43:28,2022-07-06 16:14:55
if53khs,MostRecommendation84,"&gt;Authoritarianism: a religions guiding moral principle is the basis of a states legislation, the only way you could run that country is through a single interpretation of those religions values. Religious beliefs could never be a matter of personal opinion or else youd come into too much conflict, whch Islamic Theocracies already do. Only those considered to be capable to interpret the word of god/will of the people could be in power, as the law is based on the religion of the country.

This would disqualify fascism, if we're using fascist Italy and Nazi Germany as the examples. The state was the preeminent source of morality, and Nazi Germany's relationship with both Catholic and Protestant churches was rather contentious(Hitler/Speer in private were very against Christianity, and to be fair Pius XII returned the sentiment in private against Nazism). I suppose you could point at the Francoists or Peronists, but both of those examples are hotly debated as qualifying as fascist by most historians. 

&gt; Oppression of Dissent: Anyone who objects with the religion is at best a future convert and at worst commiting blasphemy. It would be a moral imperative, from the perspective of the Theocrat, to act to preserve the moral values of God, and either convert or stop said objecting person.

Doesn't every ideology treat its objectors at best as a future convert? For this example to stand, forcible suppression of opposition would be a prerequisite, which has sometimes, but not always(or even usually) been the case with Christian or Muslim theocracies. 

&gt;Totalitarianism: The word of God knows no bounds and would influence every aspcet of life. Theocracy almost necessarily would enforce its morals in the public and private lives of its citizens and punish noncompliance (No conflicting religious beliefs, No abortions, no premarital sex etc.). I think that the only way to enforce a theocracy or a one party state is through political violence and repression of opposition.

This is the one argument I'll give you as salient, but one similarity does not mean the same. 

&gt;Anti-Egalitarian: Its a dad fact that the Bible and the Quaran both prescribe different treatment and roles in society for men and women. A traditionalist or fundamentalist view of this necessarily would enforce these gender differences in society.

Again this is where you run into some issues comparing it with fascism. Fascism generally picks and chooses which ideas progress and which ideas are conserved(for pragmatism rather than any driving core belief). For instance: abortion in Nazi Germany, permissible to keep racial purity, forbidden as an elective decision. Women were discouraged from working, until 1943 and suddenly rapidly emancipated and put to work. In contrast, theocrats will generally keep planks of their religion in place even if their nation's exploding around them.",2022-07-06 16:51:43,2022-07-06 16:51:43

That said, I feel someone's yard is a grey area. The homeowner presumably could secure himself in his house and call the police. But there is a limit to one's duty to ensure the safety of a trespasser/potential criminal.

Personally I refuse to value the life of someone else more than they appear to value mine. Trespassing, violating the safety of my home, etc, is them demonstrating they do not value my life or my safety. I won't willingly allow myself to be disadvantaged in a battle of wills in my own damn home.

I feel like we're not communicating effectively. Context matters, and in contexts where people's behavior is predictable (e.g. my neighbor that I've had a disagreement with gets up in my face on my property), its not reasonable to respond with extreme violence. I certainly don't think its reasonable or justifiable to take any legal opportunity to respond with deadly force. My point is how should we respond to uncertainty and unpredictability. 

There are times when someones behavior is unpredictable and you have no way to extricate yourself from the situation. My objection is to the claim that I should assume some of the risk involved with an inherently unpredictable situation in or around my home, for the sake of the transgressor. People who put themselves in situations where their intent is not clear, and malicious intent is reasonably expected, should be the ones to bear the cost. Sometimes that means deadly force.

&gt;The way I see in if someone in threatening me, I retreat to my home and call the police.

The U.S. has a strong cultural tradition of individualism and self-sufficiency. To rely on the police for protection or the neighborhood collective is counter to long standing cultural ideals. Of course, how much this describes a given person varies. But the cultural influence of these ideas is clear. It also helps to understand that large parts of the U.S. are very spread out, and so make it less reliable to depend on the police or collective security. The proliferation of guns also raises the stakes of any criminal encounter. Not to mention the varying cultural, economic, and racial differences that foster distrust and raise the anxiety in an interaction with an unknown person. That is, differences breed distrust (before anyone jumps on this claim, I'm black).

if5cknl,alwaysolive,"Some crimes have what is called a “mens rea” or “guilty mind” requirement, meaning that you have to have some sort of mental culpability for the crime. Others have no intent requirement and are considered “strict liability.” For example, if you drive a car while you are drunk it doesn’t matter if you knew you were over the legal limit - DUI is a strict liability crime. If you hit someone in the face because you are mad, that’s assault. But if you hit them on accident, you don’t have the intent so it’s not a crime. And it doesn’t matter if they were drunk - it matters if you were.

The law typically requires intent for rape. It’s about the person accused of the crime, not the victim. Jane could be drunk, have sex at a party, and drive away. She may be charged with DUI for driving because DUI is a strict liability crime - she drove and she was drunk. At the same time, John can still be charged for having sex with her at the party. Sex requires consent from both parties, and if Jane can’t make decisions because of the alcohol then she can’t have sex.

It all comes down to public policy decisions. Do we want to say that if you drink, you deserve anything that happens to you? Of course not! No one should be taken advantage of. Drunk people should not be manipulated into sex, or into signing contracts, or into any decisions that require them to make good choices for themselves. The law is designed to protect them from themselves. On the other hand, just because you’re drunk, does that mean you escape all responsibilities? Also no! You shouldn’t be able to get drunk and hurt people or take stupid risks, which is why you can’t drive or have guns etc. Those laws are to protect everyone else FROM drunk people.",2022-07-06 17:59:24,2022-07-06 17:59:24

in the case of drunk driving there is no other party.  ditto for murder.

You cannot accept consent from a drunk person.  Same law.  So...both.

Actual laws are complicated, but your ""being drunk"" doesn't excuse you from anything on the ""should not accept consent"" front.

Of course. There is this seeming assumption here that the laws are ridiculous or that the application of them is ridiculous.  They aren't.  It's a very difficult topic in reality, and therefore in law.

If the person who receives consent can earnestly believe that the consent is not the result of the impairment then the consent is not invalid.  

The example of neurodivergent consenter would come down to - once again - the reasonable person thinking consent was given.  There is no room in the law for a later claim of non-consent due to some reason that a reasonable person wouldn't think was bonified impairment.  Lots of gray areas in theory, some in practice.

Alternatively no adaption might evolve, if the selective pressure isn't that strong.

Also think of the time frame. The northern people that are darker than Europeans are eskimos and such, right? That's who you are talking about right?

Humans only went to North America 15 thousand years ago. While they arrived in Europe 40 thousand years ago. Yet light skin evolved in Europe relatively recently. 'Cheddar Man' a caveman they found in britain who had enough tissue to do some genetic testing, had dark skin and died 9000 years ago.

This is a very boring theme, and one that made me like the movie less. Also, we saw that they almost cut the scene. A single kiss is pathetic. I would have loved if they had a five minute romance subplot in space with some cute alien lady, rather than boring colony action.

As to the rest of your comment-you’ll notice I said balance. I never said “conservatives are right” I said being so open to new ideas that you change things that already work for no reason is bad. 

Lead has never been injected into meat sold in grocery stores, are you open to that being considered? Or do we agree that it’s a shitty idea and shouldn’t be tried?

---

&gt;Yes; shit in the street is good. It means we're treating the drug problem with some seriousness.

But that's not the only reason for shit in the streets. You're saying shit in the streets is better than fentanyl crisis. May be true may not be. But certainly shit in the streets isn't better than no shit in the streets, is it? If you could solve drug crisis with or without shit which would you pick? 

And that's where we get back to the whole point.  According to your own definition liberal thoughts are the consideration and respect of ALL opinions.  So me taking a city with no drug issues, and claiming we should stop using sewers and start shitting in the street. Surely you don't claim that's a positive?

&gt;The answer to balance isn't being intentionally close minded.

It is if there is no proof that the new process is better.  Again why should I respect the idea that injecting lead into meat is better than not doing that at all? It's absolutely reasonable to reject that out of hand unless presented with further evidence that it is sensible - this is a conservative mindset to that particular issue.

If we want to shift this to politics or global issues - a liberal mindset would have us abandon all currency in favor of cryptocurrency, simply because it is new.  And yet we've seen significant issues with cryptocurrency by having a conservative mindset and not immediately accepting new ideas simply by virtue of their newness.  

You're trying to conflate capital C Conservatives with a conservative mindset to problems.  Similarly, small l liberal is different from capital L Liberal.

---

I still think you're missing the entire point of what I'm saying, you're focusing too much on the specific issues in question. 

I don't care about lead, or crypto, or drugs or any actual issue for the purposes of these comments- they are simply vehicles of discussion to draw examples from.

At the end of the day we simply CAN'T accept and give reasonable discourse to every potential idea.  Some are dangerous, some are bad for society as a whole, and even more importantly there just isn't enough time to consider 350M different ideas before making any decision.  So instead we evaluate things with both a liberal and a conservative mindset.  We determine whether or not things appear to be working, and then determine if we change them. We determine if things are a little or a lot broken, and then we determine if we make incremental changes or we turn it on its head.  

If you're making a car and one person brings you rubber to replace stone and another person brings you a triangle, does it really make sense to give those equal weight? Of course not, the wheel turns, we just want to make an incremental change to make it lighter.  And so we reject the triangle completely, giving it no liberal consideration, and accept the rubber, a mildly conservative approach (ie. stick with wheel) and mildly liberal choice (ie. trade stone for rubber).  Wasting our resources on every shape and every product would do no good for advancement.  If I put out my rubber wheel and someone develops the multiple triangle wheel which is superior and beats out my rubber wheel, even a conservative approach tells us that now that a new idea has completely outclassed an old one, we shift to the new one.  

Hopefully you see the difference in how your view of liberal (accept and consider every view point) is limiting to advancement just as much as your view of conservative (accept nothing unless it outright proves itself superior) does.",2022-07-07 06:34:51,2022-07-07 08:15:07

if89psp,OldTiredGamer86,"I'm playing a bit of devils advocate here because I generally agree with you but here goes:

You have to consider that homophobia is different than heteronormative. 

Homophobia is fear/distain for people who are homosexual, a homophobic person could be expected to be mean to a gay man or a lesbian woman. 

Someone who supports heteronormativity is someone who thinks/promotes the idea that its ""normal"" to be strait, this is generally based off the notion that most people are strait, in the same way most people are not dwarfs. Someone who is heteronormative would probably be nice to someone who is gay (just like they would be nice to someone with dwarfism), but would believe that they/their lifestyle is atypical. Something like having the only kiss in a film being a homosexual one could (in a heteronormative persons eye) imply to children that most people (or a very larger percentage) are gay, but heteronormative people view homosexuality as more of an anomaly.

Lately there has been a significant increase in the amount of representation of LGBTQ+ people in film television and video games, this is good, but many people note that we're approaching a point of significant overrepresentation (more so with minorities than LGBTQ people)

While many people would argue heteronormativity is simply another form of homophobia, there are some key differences between the two. (though I would personally argue they're both bad, but one is ""more bad"" than the other)

if8a95j,Brave_Airport_,"Promoting individual rights, civil liberties, democracy, and free enterprise to the exclusion of all else you eventually come to the primary critique: it creates an environment where its ideals become self defeating.

By promoting individual rights you undermine group rights such that trade unions, associations, ethnic groups, political parties; become unable to advocate for the people that belong to them. Deconstructing groups to the individual level makes it becomes impossible for them to defend their civil liberties and they are gradually usurped and undermined by powerful interests like the government, or megacorporations. The idealization of the free enterprise undermines cultural mores and externalities of business operation such as pollution, broken homes, abusing workers, and the degradation of the average citizen's quality of life. Democracy has critiques going back to the Ancient Greeks who considered it as a form of government destined for tyranny as was highlighted in Plato's Republic. 

The above critique is only directed at honest actors rather than subversive people who use liberalism to hide their intentions which is an entirely different argument and a critique of neoliberalism more specifically. Liberal ideals can certainly be a force for good but if everyone believed them entirely the resulting society would have some serious issues in how it acts and operates.

if9hynx,GnosticGnome,"There was a period of time during the 20th century that was a golden age of accuracy in journalism.  We can argue the exact dates but certainly 1900s-1960s in the US, where papers and later tv networks cared deeply about accuracy.  Where if you read multiple news sources their editorials might sharply disagree but their news would be similar because they're trying to report the same facts.  A sharp difference from before - when Lincoln wanted to publish the Lincoln Douglas debates he had to get his speeches from pro Lincoln papers and Douglas's from pro Douglas papers because the papers totally misrepresented the other sides' speeches.  

Journalism slowly declined after the 60s, and today has gotten to the point where Fox and CNN disagree on basic facts.  That's different from the 1990s and very different from the 1960s.  But not as bad as the 1850s.  Anyway I think it's fair to call it post truth as we really have gotten much worse than existed within our memory.

---

Blip in time yes, but that's what a post-X era means.  The postwar era was the late 40s/1950s, WWII had ended, doesn't mean there would never be war again. News has gone way downhill (coasted a while through 2000 or so even after the golden age was over) and is in a post truth era.  Could be great 15 years from now, it isn't today.

It's not just about ""which stories are told"".  It's about accuracy in those stories.  There was a time when reporter was a solid middle class profession.  You fact checked because otherwise you'd lose your job and it was a good job.  If you said that there were 10,000 people at a rally and there were 1000 you'd lose credibility maybe readers maybe a job.  It was a big deal.  Now no.  A reporter today could make better money as a transcriptionist.  They aren't in it as a professional, they're in it to make a difference, and there's nothing at stake by lying or failing to check.

It's not just more voices (most cities no longer have multiple papers) although to an extent its true.  But it's about literally not caring about verifiable facts.

if9s7s4,AULock1,"&gt;So let’s start with the arguments, In today society in all around the world, The urbanists are very worried about the rising of segregation of urban space, with the rich and poor living far from each other The social divide cause class clashing and rise of crime, The cities with most unequal social divide are more violent and has less quality of life for all citizens.

Source? Because in my city the wealthy areas are amazing, the middle class areas are really nice, and the poor areas are hellholes. I think the lower quality of life only applies to the poor areas. However id love to see some data showing everyone has a lower quality of life when the poor are in different neighborhoods. 

&gt; 1) Social capital:lower income people will interact with higher income people and that’s will increase the benefits of the lower income people to interact and socialize with people different of their own and this even can create opportunities of employment because you interact with people outside of your circle.

Where will this interaction happen? Lower income people can't afford country clubs or social society memberships. You think they'll interact in Kroger and suddenly be friends? The wealthy will still interact with their wealthy peers, because even in these mixed income neighborhoods, you won't have a $3,000,000 house on the same street as a $500,000 house. There will still be some stratification. 

&gt; 2) Higher income people are more likely to care more about safety and order,So this will be beneficial for lower income people because its not a discrimination against lower income people but usually higher income people have higher standarts about where they live and this will benefit lower income people that live in the area.

But won't the lower income people, by virtue of the fact that they need to make ends meet, resort to crime? You're relying on the wealthy to somehow police the activities of the poor, when in reality what will happen is the area will quickly gentrify and the poor will be priced out.

 

&gt; 3) Higher income people will bring more high quality services to the area can bring bussiness and other services that would not be in the first place.

How do you figure? 

&gt; 4) Lower income people will benefit for living in a more safer place that people cared about and this is going to help lift them from poverty

Why? They're still poor, its not like they will magically become doctors or lawyers or executives because they live in close proximity to wealthy people. 

&gt; 5)Better understanding of each other when higher income and low income people coexist and live together they can leave some discrimination against each others,Higher income people will stop seeing lower income as “lazy” and other misconceptions and lower income will not see higher income as “ souless that only thinks about money” with the interaction they will form good friendships with each other and will be good.



no they won't, because your whole premise is based on the idea that they will be forced to interact with one another. Thats simply not realistic. The wealthy have money, so if the schools suck, they will send their kids to private school. If the neighborhood starts going downhill, they will move away. They are not bound by any force to stay in that neighborhood. Thats why wealthy areas exist - the people with money self-segregate to be closer to their peers and maintain their property values.

---

1) Why would they go to parks? Schools could get better, but they could also get worse. With private and charter schools, if the school suddenly tanks, the wealthy will yank their kids out. My old high school was one of the best in the state, before some superintendent decided it wasn't fair to keep it only for our neighborhood. So they started a bus in program from one of the poorer neighborhoods. The quality of instruction dropped, so plenty of parents moved their kids to the private school a few miles away. 

2) I read through the paper (its not a study, its a literature review), I dont see where it is dismisses that argument. Feel free to quote it so I can dig into the sources, but from a cursory reading that isn't what's said. The ""people have a good feeling of safety"" line means nothing in terms of crime statistics. 

3) in terms of property taxes? or how? most of the wealthy neighborhoods ive lived in dont have ANY services. They're cordoned off and gated. 

4) Youre simply claiming they will have greater opportunities. By that logic, if poor people started hanging out in the Beverly Hills Starbucks, they'll have more opportunities to be wealthy. 

5) Because Denmark has the lowest income inequality in the world. They dont have ""poor"" people and ""rich"" people as we understand it, the government taxes wealth so heavily that no one achieves massive wealth. Comparing that model to the US is intellectually ignorant. You're claiming the wealthy don't benefit from the class divide in the US but the objectively do.

**First, you've assumed a narrow utilitarian framework.** That is, all your reasons can be boiled down to, ""murder is wrong because it causes pain"" (or forms of pain, like fear or grief). There is no consideration of one's right to live, nor of moral principles that might exist regardless of whether a particular outcome is good or not. It's worth considering that there are other moral frameworks out there, and there are reasons to be skeptical of utilitarianism. But that's a whole can of worms, so I'll stick to a utilitarian analysis.

**Second, it assumes perfect knowledge**. Part of the reason that even many utilitarians would reject this sort of thinking is that it is impossible. You simply cannot know that a crime won't be discovered. You cannot know with 100% certainty that this hermit actually has no one who cares about him. You cannot even know that killing him will be painless. Are you so practiced and precise that you're certain beyond all doubt exactly how to kill him instantaneously, with no chance for error? Do you know what comes after death, so that you can say with certainty that he won't greatly suffer there?

Entertaining moral hypotheticals is fun, but we usually make them to draw real conclusions about how we should act. If we're to gain a lesson from your scenario, it might be that building uncertainty into your moral calculus is a good idea, precisely because these assumptions are impossible. And if we add in uncertainty, this scenario would always be immoral (unless you believed there were corresponding *good* outcomes from killing him that would outweigh the possible bad outcomes).

**Third, even restricted to your hypothetical, you do not consider the hermit's potential happiness.** Even if the hermit does not experience pain in the moment, you are snuffing out any future happiness he may encounter. Assuming that you believe that happiness is a desirable thing, removing its possibility would be bad. You could try to counter this by saying that it's more likely he'll live a painful, unhappy life than a happy one. But again, you're not a soothsayer. You simply do not know what his life will be like (indeed, we don't even know what his life is like *now*, except that he is a hermit).

**Fourth, you also don't consider how this would affect** ***the person who does the killing***. People who kill other people very often suffer significant negative psychological consequences, even when that killing was justified. Aversion to murdering other people is hardwired into our biology, not to mention how ingrained it becomes through cultural reinforcement. To kill someone in the absence of any reason at all would almost certainly be bad for the killer--and assuming this person returns to society, it would in turn be bad for society.",2022-07-08 07:52:50,2022-07-08 07:52:50

To answer your first question about a fair standard for drawing a district: well there really isn’t one. *Essentially state legislatures and one political party control the redrawing process. So they get full control on how political races are carried out.* 

So the way gerrymandering is actually carried out is through 2 techniques, “cracking” and “packing”. 

Cracking is when people with the same characteristics, such as voting preferences into multiple districts. Their voting strength becomes diluted and so they end up struggling to elect their preferred candidate in any district. 

Packing is then the opposite, where voters with the same political beliefs are packed into a few areas, thus giving them mostly all the voting strength. What happens with the rest of the areas is that people in those areas do not have voting strength that those few areas do. 

**To answer your question about the “potential” to gerrymander.. well in 2010 republicans tried to gain as much control as state legislatures as possible.They ended up controlling 213 congressional districts and what followed was the redrawing of maps and some of the most extreme cases of gerrymandering in history. In battle ground Pennsylvania, republicans locked down on 13 of 18 of the states congressional districts even in elections where democrats won the majority of the statewide congressional vote.** 

As a matter of fact, your state of Michigan has been victim to some of the worst cases of gerrymandering, which gave republicans an extra 7 to 10 Republican seats in the House of Representatives. 

*To answer your last question, remember that packing and cracking can be done independently of one another or together. The ultimate goal of them is to give some districts more power than others even though it is not representational of the actual cities and towns in a state and how they vote.*

Remember that with more power in the HoR, that’s federal power, they control the direction of our country. Often times that’s why the American government is so ineffective because bills get bottlenecked in the House. They don’t get passed and make it to the senate. The House is critical for American democracy.

&gt; While you are 100% wrong about the constitutionality of gun restrictions and the evidence behind concealed carry and I think it should consistently be noted that the current supreme court are bad faith political actors before their are impartial judges, I somewhat agree with your point.

I fully believe that a truly apolitical Supreme Court that was actually an advocate for civil rights would have ruled unanimously to overturn NY's proper cause requirement.  The constitution makes it clear that citizens have the right to carry arms.  Whether you or I agree that people *should* be allowed to is beside the point; NY's law basically said that being granted or denied that right was based on someone's opinion.  This kind of licensing regime [allowed a bribery scheme](https://apnews.com/article/5dc2beaa630145c89049f6294afe7782) to thrive in NYC. 

&gt; With that said, anybody on the left right now would call bull shit on forcing any law to go through a lifetime appointed federal judge.

!delta for this. A major overhaul is definitely needed.  Whether it's a conservative state or a liberal one, bad actors seems to have little to no restriction or accountability. 

&gt; Nothing about the NY law would turn anybody into felons over night. 

Except if you need to use public transit, eat, shop for groceries, or any other normal thing that everyone does. 

&gt; You own a gun, you leave it at home. Simple as that.

Yes, that's idea behind this torrent of new legislation; to make it nearly impossible to carry without committing a felony.  Tell me, how come it takes years to pass laws for things like tenant protections, but half a dozen new gun laws get signed in a week?

---

&gt; the entire justification for concealed carry is the concept that it is supposed to reduce crime because of the threat of a concealed gun by a trained and responsible citizen

The ""justification"" for CCW has never been that they are now some quasi-police force that is going to reduce crime.  It has always been about an individuals right to self defense.  And in that sense it does work as intended. 

&gt; Defensive use of guns by crime victims is a common occurrence, although the exact number remains disputed (Cook and Ludwig, 1996; Kleck, 2001a). Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010). National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2013. Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. https://doi.org/10.17226/18319. 

&gt; A different issue is whether defensive uses of guns, however numerous or rare they may be, are effective in preventing injury to the gun-wielding crime victim. Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns (i.e., incidents in which a gun was “used” by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies (Kleck, 1988; Kleck and DeLone, 1993; Southwick, 2000; Tark and Kleck, 2004). National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2013. Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. https://doi.org/10.17226/18319.

[[source](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/18319/chapter/3#15)]

&gt; With that said, the Heller case is very often a case where legal scholars say the conservative judges were acting as activists before judges.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I wouldn't call denying a total ban on handguns as ""acting as activists"".  What the more liberal states have been doing over the past couple of decades is push more and more consecutive gun laws to chip away at the 2a little by little.  The obvious goal is to make legal gun ownership effectively impossible without being explicitly banned, and there must be a limit somewhere.  Of course any SCOTUS ruling that strikes down a gun control law will be called ""activist"" by some.  It's funny to me that everyone seems to be fine with rights being eroded, as long as it's the second.  

&gt; My point is that under the law. The person now has a choice.

Actually no, the intent of the law is to *remove* choice, and it's being done in a very underhanded way.  The Bruen ruling explicitly called out the fact that they can't make the entire island of Manhattan a ""sensitive place"".  So instead, they're going to name every individual place a person might go a ""sensitive place"" instead.  The first time someone gets arrested for having their CCW in a park, it's going to get challenged and likely struck down.

---

&gt; Okay but the evidence we both clearly at pretty clearly states that having easy to obtain  concealed carry permits leads to more violent crime.

It doesn't.  All we see is a correlation between the rising number of CCW holders and rising violent crime.  Does violent crime increase because of permit holders, or is the number of CCWs increasing in response to increasing violent crime?  It's an important question that you don't know the answer to. 

&gt; B) people are misreading situations and thinking they are acting in self defense which escalates the threat in the situation which gets someone shot where they otherwise wouldn't.

This is called brandishing.  It's a crime (a felony in a lot of states) which would almost certainly result in a revoked permit.  Since we don't see large scale permit revocations, this doesn't seem to be the case either. 

&gt; Also 11 times more likely to commit suicide than act in self defense.

This is a very misleading and disingenuous statistic.  This makes it sound like gun owners turn the gun on themselves when someone breaks into their house. Also, I have enough respect for people who struggle with suicidal depression to not label it a ""gun problem"". 

&gt; I can't argue with someone's right to be ignorant

Ironic, really. 

&gt; I would also add that it is disingenuous to claim that people don't think concealed carry is a deterrent.

I'm not exactly sure what you mean by this, but in NY and a number of other states, it's actually illegal to tell anyone you're carrying.  It's also illegal for the gun or holster to be visible at all (such as printing where you can see the outline of it).  For me and every other CCW holder I know it's an absolute last resort to save my life or that of a loved one.  I honestly don't know where you got this impression that we are some kind of cartoon cowboy caricature that walk around twirling our guns around our finger and light our cigars by shooting them. 

&gt; No. The supreme court had previously ruled in favor of gun bans. The supreme court failed to act with judicial restraint by not utilizing those rulings in this case. This is really a disputed fact besides with bad faith actors.

The supreme court once upheld slavery.  When that was overturned, were they ""bad faith actors"" because they didn't follow previous decisions?  Seems like you're fine with pretending that the constitution doesn't exist, as long as the case involves the second amendment. 

&gt; If I had to guess, I would guess that the goal is to respond to the problems in our society, not to get rid of the second amendment specifically.

More like politicians never waste a tragedy and use them to push their political agenda.  Again, NY takes years or even decades to pass laws for things like tenant rights, but the gun laws were rushed through in a week?  Sorry, but I'm calling bullshit there. 

&gt; Yeah the supreme court made a non-sensical overreaching ruling

This statement honestly strains credulity.  SCOTUS was asked if the 'proper cause' requirement was constitutional, they ruled it was not.  Would you be ok with a proper cause requirement being applied to your fourth amendment right?  So police can search your home or your car anytime they want, and you need to have a valid reason (in the opinion of the officer) for them not to?  The SCOTUS has stated on a number of occasions over the years that the second amendment is not a ""second class right"". 

&gt; That's the way laws work. 

The way that laws work is that the higher courts set a precedent that states and lower courts are supposed to uphold.  Instead, you have bad faith actors trying to circumvent that precedent. 

&gt; I was saying someone will actively have to make the choice to break the law while you were trying to say that they have no choice but to bring a gun to a school or some non-sense.

The ruling says that citizens have the right to carry outside of their home.  I'm sorry if you disagree with that, but that is the law now.  NY is now in open defiance of the supreme court ruling. 

&gt; Like, private entities are entitled every where to restrict gun possession. Are you against that too? Why is it so important for you that people be allowed to bring a gun to a park?

It's honestly none of their business, and they'll never know.  Again, NY is notorious for trying to circumvent the rights of it's citizens.  The vast majority of gun crime is committed with guns that were obtained illegally, so why spend so much time and effort on the ones who are actually acting lawfully?  The answer is that these laws have absolutely nothing to do with reducing gun violence or ""protecting"" anyone.  It's no coincidence that the states with the strictest gun laws also have the highest concentration of wealthy people.  

As an aside, the extremest anti-gun position is losing ground among liberals.  [More and more](https://subredditstats.com/r/liberalgunowners) folks on the left are realizing the importance of the right to gun ownership.  If the democratic leadership could just let go of their hard-on for gun bans, they'd be winning a hell of a lot more elections.

---

Subjective opinion perhaps, but if the highest revocation rate you could find is less than half of a percent, and the rest are a fraction of that, I wouldn't say that it's ""a lot"".  Hell, if the conviction rate of the general population were that low, the US would be a damn utopia. 

&gt; A couple quick things here. I more and more states have made it so you don't need a permit to carry

I understand and don't necessarily agree with that.  I think there should be a licensing regime that includes training and compressive background checks, but the process shouldn't be overly restrictive or subjective. 

&gt;  you seem to be well informed on gun rights.

Unfortunately as a NY gun owner, I have to be.  It's actually hard to keep track with new restrictions coming out damn near every week, and it's *very* easy to accidentally break the law.  Most are written to be intentionally confusing and onerous.",2022-07-06 09:42:03,2022-07-08 13:11:30

ifgd4tk,xylek64,"I agree with your sentiment. I am also very passionate about climate change.

However, it's not as simple as people often make it sound. Our society is, quite literally, built on unsustainable practices. Uprooting that is not something that is in the power of any one politician, so making it our #1 priority is both unrealistic and impossible to happen within 10-20 years. I'll use the example I'm currently seeing play out.

I work as an engineer at a natural gas combined cycle power plant. It's a smaller plant, with 3 units (3 gas turbines, 3 steam turbines) that produce around 250-300 MW each, for a combined base load of 900 MW. Some larger scale plants produce MW in the thousands.

Our company recently shut down a bunch of coal plants. We're now facing a summer of record-breaking heat waves without a whole fleet of power production. We have been purchasing up to 3000 MW of power to meet demand than we are making just to keep the lights on for people, and a lot of that power is being purchased from neighboring independent fossil power plants. Currently, the company is making plans to replace the power lost from the coal plants by building some clean energy plants. But there's a large debate on how that needs to be done.

Solar energy is one of the most inefficient methods of producing power. The panels require a lot of space. Even with solar cells being as advanced as they are, it takes around 3 acres to produce 1 MW of power. So, for a solar farm to match what we produce at my plant, they would have to clear cut around 5-6 square miles to install the panels. Additionally, we don't have a good way to store energy, so in the evening, during peak demand, the solar panels are producing nothing. Then any day you have rain or clouds, you're out of luck.

Wind farms have a similar issue with the space to power ratio. They just can't produce as much per land mass as coal or gas. Wind turbines obviously have to be in very windy places. You'll only see wind farms in any significance in the midwest, around flatlands in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. These are useless in most of the US where the wind is not blowing all the time, and of course, weather affects them too.

Hydro is actually quite efficient, but it's not possible to make them on a large enough scale to replace coal or gas. For example, one of our largest hydro plants produces about 80 MW. And we only have so many rivers we can dam up.

Nuclear is one of the best methods of producing power. It's totally clean, doesn't take up a lot of land mass, and it produces a lot of power. One unit can generate between 500-1000 MW, and some plants have 3-5 units. But the red tape regulations around designing nuclear plants makes it hard to build and keep them running. Many nuclear plants have been shut down because people complain to their politicians about the ""dangers"" of having local nuclear plants.

A big thing to keep in mind is when they decide where to put them and what plant to build, that doesn't happen overnight. For example, it can take years to get a nuclear plant approved because there's literally thousands of pages of documentation and regulations before they even start building. This will take billions of dollars just to build one plant. And they're complex, precise structures. Once they start building, it will take usually more than a decade to finish. You're looking at seeing that nuclear plant in operation a good 20 years from now.

And cars. Cars are moving to electric, which is great, sure. Although, electric cars are hard to maintain and fall short of gas. The range on an electric car usually isn't as much as a tank of gas will get you, and if you're on a long trip, ""refueling"" isn't as fast as just pumping gas in your tank. There's also the infrastructure problem, and I don't know where you live, but there's not a charging station at my apartment. The closest charging station is 80 miles away. Lastly, what do you think will happen when everyone switches to electric when the power company is already struggling to meet demand?

The best thing we can do right now is to focus on plastics, which would help with legislation, but there's a lot we can do as the people to pressure companies to reduce plastic production, or to pick up trash, or start recycling programs. Going green is important, but it just can't happen in the next 10-20 years. That's idealistic at best, and we need scientists and engineers at the front of that effort, not politicians. Politicians don't have a plan on HOW to fix the problem, they just make promises that they can't keep. In the meantime, I think it's more than okay to focus on social problems that if not addressed, would only serve to worsen the climate problem (war, for example, is very bad for the environment).",2022-07-09 02:04:50,2022-07-09 02:04:50

The first part of the book focuses on how the idea of human rights are often justified by religion, or cultural norms which vary from location to location and between different cultures. Since these cannot be used to justify the idea of universal rights or morality, there needs to be another origin. 

The latter two thirds focus on how human rights can only be widely accepted if they are based on remedying past wrongs that society wants to avoid happening in the future.

ifih67d,[deleted],"Your entire stance relies upon people being of a sound and calm state of mind and sufficiently self-restrained to not use violence in the face of extreme provocation, simply because that provocation is in the form of words.

This ignores honor cultures where someone is expected to respond to slander and provocation with violence, people who have been raised in traumatic and verbally abusive environments for whom verbal assault is triggering, and people who are going through great personal stress and aren't currently capable of emotional regulation.

It also puts violence as the worst thing a person could do without qualification, when there's actually a well known pattern of men getting into fights and ending up as friends with the matter resolved, and plenty of situations where brief, non-maiming violence is the most direct and effective solution to an issue.

Sometimes a good punch is what's needed. Sometimes someone is driven past the edge of rationality and can't restrain themselves.

If someone is being deliberately provacative, they're essentially poking you with words, trying to push you into action, and get you to swing first. They're instigating, even if they aren't the first to use violence.

Just because your own experience, upbringing and personality makes it hard to relate to people who use violence in response to words doesn't mean that those who do are crazy or wrong.",2022-07-09 13:09:42,2022-07-09 13:09:42

ifip6rk,McKoijion,"That's like saying a wheelchair can't replace working legs. It's true, but once you're in that predicament, it's the best you can do. If you want to change society by ending war so that soldiers don't have their legs blown off, then you can also skip paying for their wheelchairs. But if you want the money and power that comes from waging war, you need to cover the healthcare of the participants too.

Similarly, the whole appeal of condoms, birth control pills, morning after pills, and abortions is that you can have sex without pregnancy. There shouldn't be any stigma attached to premarital sex because this newly developed technology means that you will never harm any children. If you're going to force me to go to an unnecessary war in a draft so you can make money, you better pay for my wheelchair when my legs are blown off. If you're going to force me to have a baby instead of an abortion to because you think it's a living human being because of your strange religious, non-scientific beliefs, you better pay for that baby.

This gets to the crux of the problem. If you think a fetus is a living human person, then abortion is murder. But a fetus doesn't develop the bare minimum brain structures to house a consciousness/soul/mind until about 6 months after conception. So I consider abortion to be the moral equivalent of a haircut. Or better yet, a heart transplant. A fetus is alive just like my heart is alive. But if you cut out my heart and give me a new one, my heart will die, but I will live. On the other hand, if my brain dies, but you transplant my heart into someone else, then I will be dead even though my heart will live on. Living fetuses and hearts don't matter. It's just our earthly body. My consciousness/soul/mind that is housed in the upper parts of my brain are all that matters. 

I completely agree with you in all other respects. As soon as a fetus develops a consciousness/soul/mind, then it's a human and killing it is murder. I'm just as pro-life as you. But I understand modern medicine enough to know that the idea of love comes from the brain, not the heart like so many people thought in the past. The funny thing is that Christian theologians were never wrong about this. They distinguished between the immortal soul and the earthly body. They just didn't have access to MRI machines, EEGs, etc. to figure out exactly where this division occurs.

---

Perhaps, but if you want to risk ruining your own life with premarital sex, that's your choice. If your consenting adult partner also wants to take that risk, that's their choice. If you use modern technology, there's 0% child of a child being born from your recreational sex, so you aren't risking hurting anyone else. Condoms, contraception, and morning after pills aren't 100% effective at preventing pregnancy, but abortions are 100% effective at ending pregnancies. If you ban abortion, you're taking something that has a 0% chance of harming children, and converting it to something that has a good chance of harming children. If you want to force people to do that, then you have to pay to help those children. 

Again, I think abortion means killing living human tissue without any consciousness/soul/mind. That's something we commonly do to ourselves all the time without any moral consideration. But causing even the smallest bit of physical or psychological damage to a living baby/child is wrong.

---

I agree life begins at fertilization (and so does every scientist). But I don't think living human tissue has any moral standing. Only a human consciousness/soul/mind matters. Our bodies are just machines used to keep our consciousness/soul/mind alive. If I could transfer my mind into a new body, I'd still be alive even though all my living cells would die. But if you deleted my mind and transferred someone else's mind into my body, I'd be dead. 

A fetus is just human tissue until it develops a bare minimum mind/consciousness/soul. Even one tiny bit of consciousness would give it full rights and personhood in my opinion. But a fetus doesn't have 0.0001% the consciousness of a baby. They have 0%. We know this as a fact because we know exactly what brain structures are needed to house the bare minimum of a mind/consciousness/soul, and we know it takes about 6 months to form the earliest version of those structures. Coincidentally (or not coincidentally at all), that's also the point at which the baby can survive on its own outside the mother.",2022-07-09 11:42:20,2022-07-09 14:09:42

Yes, you misread it.

Now it only has the former and lost the latter. 

At the same time the anti-choice side DIDN'T have the opportunity to pass EITHER state level OR federal abortion bans, because those would have been unconstitutional.

ifiwgxg,Genoscythe_,"&gt;There's this constant fear among both the right and the left in my opinion of cultures mixing and synthesizing.

I would comment on just that line.

I would say, that neither the left nor the right inherently cares about cultures mixing for it's on sake, their positions on it are both contextual.

The right primarily cares about preserving social hierarchies, (whether it is racial, wealth, or gendered hierarchies).

The left cares about challenging social hierarchies and installing more egalitarian structures.

The right will support cultural exchange *when it benefits maintaining a hierarchy*. US southern white supremacists loved borrowing black culture within minstrel shows, as long as they got to establish that they were on top of the pyramid and that they used the culture that they took, for mockery. Colonizers held world fairs where they showed off the exotic treasures of the colonies that they owned. Orientalist art was a huge fad in the ultra-conservative aristocratic courts of Europe.  Adolf Hitler was a big fan of Karl May's pulpy indian adventure stories, not at all worried about them being impure or not german enough. (He also ripped off the swastika from the *other* indians).

The right will only be concerned about cultural exchange when it threatens their supremacy, when it threatens their race, their religious authority, their family being automatically in charge of society by birthright, but they won't mind taking bits and pieces of culture from their subjuated victims or from exotic foreigners and using it for their own self-aggrandisation. 

So they will oppose immigrants becoming citizens, they will whine about minorities being respectfully represented as heroes in Hollywood movies, They will oppose anything that would direct wealth and prestige away from the current elites and towards the marginalized.

With the left it's exactly the reverse. The left is generally open to cultural mixing for the sake of upending supremacy, but heavily critical of cultural exchange that exists to perpetuate it, such as exploitative stereotypes, or economically unfair taking of cultural signifiers from vulnerable groups.

The point is that ""cultures mixing"" is not inherently good or bad in most people's perspective, what matters is whether it is mxing in a way that makes people more equal, or less.",2022-07-09 15:05:30,2022-07-09 15:05:30

Something important to take into consideration I think tho is that we've never been here before. Women and men have never been so broadly equal on so many levels as they now so we're trying to figure things out as we go. Especially men, men are having to relinquish control and sense of superiority which (as unjustified as it's always been) is radically different than how we've done things.

ifjd7ez,CrapulantDrunk,"I'm going to basically spend the whole time talking about your last point because I feel like the other points will be covered by others. The way you talk about martyrdom betrays the fact that you essentially have a utilitarian moral framework from which you are approaching the issue. This is largely at odds with the actual reasons for most of these kinds of suicides. They tend to come to it from a deontological position or one of virtue ethics. It just seems odd to say that martyrdom isn't a result of a sound mind because it might not lead to the right consequence when this line of thinking isn't the reason why most martyrs historically actually commit suicide. Socrates did commit suicide (and it was a suicide for the means to avoid his execution where readily available to him) because of a deontological commitment to the laws of the polis. It is not the product of some calculation. When Cato the younger killed himself it was because the republic that he venerated was being destroyed and his cause had failed. He didn't kill himself to cause some change in the world. You clearly are interested in what these people think because you spend a lot of time talking about it. You need to commit then to actually understanding what they think and not imposing your ideas onto them and saying they aren't rational because they aren't conforming to your world view when they never intended to.

I've noticed that this is true for all of your other points. You are clearly committed to consequentialism. Which I suppose is fine except you presume it to be true and by failing to even acknowledge any sort of other ethical systems you presume them to be false.

ifjlbif,Philiatrist,"This is a bit of a tired argument. The phrase as stated is intended as *hyperbole*. The sentiment is mostly that the US does poorly amongst first world nations, *given* that it’s the wealthiest amongst them.

But I’ll go through your points and address them and see if I can add some perspective.

Corruption, yes, not comparable. The United States has more of a corrupt bureaucracy, which is a different (and by some standards better) thing to suffer under. The struggle here is that a lot of the corruption is codified and legalized. Huge subsidies, bailouts, shadow political donations, laws written entirely by corporations and passed by politicians. A lot of our corruption is by and large, legal. It’s much better, but also frustrating and depressing. I can certainly understand why seeing outright illegal shit makes you feel this is nothing to complain about, but it is still very bleak when you think about just how difficult it is to change.

True, there is less poverty here, but you also can’t compare $300 in Bolivia to the US, the cost of living here is also significantly greater which means people need to make significantly more than $300 to not be homeless in the US. The conversion rate for minimum income is just not a good metric for poverty. Yeah, you can look at a fast food worker in the US making so much money and think you’d be so comfortable in Bolivia, but they also have to *pay the US price for everything*, so a huge portion of their paycheck goes towards the roof over their head.

Education is complicated, it depends, a lot of very powerful and damaging lies are more subtle than outright propaganda. We have a lot of textbooks with lies and a lot of people trying to actively rewrite history and minimize/remove Native American genocide and chattel slavery from our books. More recently, Texas teachers were advised they needed to present “both sides” of the Holocaust due to concerns that white children are being taught they are evil. You’re right though, it’s not so much one political party writing self-serving propaganda as it is white supremacy. Still a lot of shitty lies and omissions, it’s very tragic to see children being taught this way.

On paper, the murder rate in the US is about 3x that of Bolivia. I’m willing to believe those numbers are inaccurate, but major US cities are *much, much closer* to those of Latinamerica in terms of murder than they do any other first world nation.

The justice system here is still corrupt, but again, it’s more codified in large part than outright illegal activity under the table. Judges who own stakes in for-profit prisons have been caught sending all manner of vulnerable juvenile there on little to nothing. Because we live in a very free capitalist society, there’s nothing inherently illegal about being a judge who profits directly from a prison’s success and also being “tough on crime”. Of course, we have the highest incarceration rate and a fucking ton of it is minorities in prison for possession of marijuana.

Public services can’t be bought here in the bribery sense, but they still serve wealth before all else. It’s more like which neighborhood you live in depends on how you get service or not, there’s no option for bribery.",2022-07-09 18:27:17,2022-07-09 18:27:17

---

&gt;It wouldn’t be lying however. You are just keeping your attractions to yourself which is perfectly normal. 

Yes, but sooner or later your parents will likely ask you about whether or not you're dating. They will also probably have 'the talk' with you at some point. 

&gt;I find it kind of sad and creepy that many parents automatically assume that their child is attracted to the opposite gender

But that doesn't change the fact that parents *do* assume this.

To be open with you, your posts contain a lot of language about how society *should* be. You say parents *should* not care about sexuality. You say parents *should* not assume their child's attractions. But that doesn't describe reality.

ifjww7d,koannn,"Ever hear the parable about the pencil? How nobody knows how to make a pencil?

It's an illustration of the wonder of markets and division of labor. There are thousands of people involved in the production of a pencil.

No one person knows how to make a pencil. And yet, pencils get made. Did thousands of people *conspire* to make it? Just the fact that a pencil is *desired* and someone is willing to pay for one sets this whole supply chain in motion to produce it.

Why does your giving have to be tied to a particular religion (Christianity)? Are you not willing to help the hungry of other religions or hungry atheists? 

And exactly how do you know that someone at the church is actually hungry and not just saying they are to get your cash? One reason I much rather fund government welfare programmes is that they are more likely to spend the money on those who are actually in need as they check that you really fit criteria before giving you food stamps (or whatever method your country uses to distribute welfare). 

Yes, that generates some bureaucracy, which is why I'd like to move to UBI based system, but at least it tries to distribute the allocated funds according to some well thought out rules instead of anyone saying: ""I'm hungry and a Christian, give me money"" =&gt; Get money.

The problem with the charity in most cases is that for charities it's beauty contest. It doesn't matter how good you are relieving the world suffering as long as you're good at marketing that what you do is to fix the most important bad thing in the world. People generally don't have time to research what is the most efficient things to do, but just usually give to charities that make them feel good. That's why charities that help children cancer are flush with money and the ones helping less sexy targets but where the money could actually make more of a difference are poor. There are organizations like [GiveWell](https://givewell.org), who try to do this work for you, but I think a very small percentage of the total charity money goes through them. I'm sure ""well, I gave at the church"" is far more common. 

The point I'm making is that government can do three things here. 

One, it can spread the burden evenly. When the helping cost is done from the taxes it makes people less likely to freeride (since everyone else is giving to fix this problem, I don't need to). Basically it's the same function that the social pressure with the collection plate does. Social pressure doesn't work in modern society with millions of members as well as it did in tribal societies with 100 members. That's why you have to replace it with something else. 

Two, it can do things that are most efficient at helping people. It can test what programs work and what don't and then cancel those that work. The charities don't really have any accountability to their donors and can do whatever they want. 

Three, it can prioritize things that people democratically think are the most important ones. This can lead to the ""money to the children cancers"" to some extent, but it's less likely because of number 2.",2022-07-08 04:04:09,2022-07-10 00:46:21

So, given that the aid originates from a multilateral deal, you can't just cut Israel's. Should we cut everyone's aid in the region? Probably, but that's a different CMV than only Israel.",2022-07-10 06:01:27,2022-07-10 06:01:27

ifn5gfw,KallistiTMP,"Others have gone over all the reasons that we are almost entirely certain that EM sensitivity is not a real thing, and that all examined cases have been found to be a nocebo effect, but I wanted to add that another possibility for some people is simple misattribution of physical symptoms caused by something else.

As an example, say someone lives near an airport and starts getting headaches shortly after. They can see a large antenna array out their window, and come to the conclusion that the EM radiation from the antenna is the cause. A few months later they move out into a rural area and the symptoms stop.

The person might mistake this for confirmation of their suspected EM sensitivity. But in reality, they could have started getting headaches because of the poor air quality, or because of getting lower quality sleep at night due to the airport's noise level.

This is why these experimental tests that control for all outside factors are so crucial. There are many things that might *correlate* with perceived EM sources. The actions that people take to escape the perceived source of their symptoms might also happen to line up with something that resolves the actual source of the problem as well - especially since the things people do in response to a perceived EM sensitivity tend to be major sweeping lifestyle changes. 

The things that people do to avoid imagined EM effects also happen to line up pretty well with what your doctor is already telling you to do. Less screen time, more natural sunlight and fresh air, intentionally disconnecting from social media, taking more walks in nature to stay fit, cooking fresh healthy food instead of living off microwave dinners, etc.

So, while so far to date all studied cases of reported EM sensitivity have been debunked, it's not surprising that people might mistakenly come to that conclusion, and even end up resolving the actual underlying causes of their health issues in the process. It's incredibly likely that the majority of cases of reported EM sensitivity are in fact simple eyestrain, or insomnia aggrevated by electronic device usage or artificial lighting.",2022-07-10 14:14:20,2022-07-10 14:14:20
ifn7yz7,hungryCantelope,"your arriving at a poor conclusion because you started with a bad premise, I'll explain. Before deconstructing you position ill give the immediate answer to you question, ""why not?"" because their isn't demand for one.  Men don't want this, you offered a hypothetical reason for it, but having a space for men to support each other doesn't require women to be absent, you can have male comradery in regular gym space.  Your hypothetical makes no sense and it feels like the real reason your came to that conclusion was because you don't like being discriminated against so your looking for a solution is compatible with the fact that you realize the women receive unwanted interactions and that isn't sexist

To be clear, such a policy is sexist, the solution is actually pretty straight foreword.  If customers want to not interact with strangers the gym could offer an area with certain rules, basically a minimal interaction area, don't look at each other, don't talk to each other, any more than the minimum needed to navigate using a public gym. Anyone willing to follow those rules can be allowed in that area.  This would fix the problem without discriminating against men or reinforcing the sexist idea that a man looking at or speaking to a women is categorically harassment.(not saying women aren't allowed to consider this stuff annoying but the categorization of it has harassment is an absurd framing that if you sat down and really hashed it out with them they would realize they don't even agree with it)

Having a mens only section so they can bro out not only isn't desired by people but doesn't actually fix the underlying problem you have regarding sexism  As soon as you accept the premise that there should be a women's only section (implying that any interaction a man has with a women is sexual in nature), the you have accepted that treating people based on their demographic is okay.  It feels like you are trying to have your cake and eat it to regarding  egalitarianism.  Either you accept men and women are different and should be treated differently (in which case those difference would be individually addressed based on their merit, not in an attempt to even out some kind of theoretical scoreboard), or you you reject that idea and try and make everything match, but you don't try and fix a non-existent problem  in order to even things out just for the sake of a theoretical victory in order to bluster the illusion that you still subscribe to that theory. Because what you end up with isn't matching what you end up is just 2 different statements one for each group. If men interact with women it's harassments, if women interact with men it's disrupting bro time, see you haven't actually restored balance, you just even up a meaningless scoreboard of abstract points, one-to-one.

One last note, if there is an actual reason men want that, and we persrcibe to a less elgalitarain view, then we could provide that for them, but the reason wouldn't be *well we gave women something so we need to give men something* it would be becaue there was an actual need for it, the issue with you hypothetical is that you have no real reason to believe it's a need in the real world, you just used it as a prop  in your scorekeeping arugement, then said ""but why not"", why not isn't a reason,  and the obvious answer is it costs resource to have dedicated stuff for limited use.",2022-07-10 14:32:20,2022-07-10 14:32:20

Anime in general was considered children's programming and when brought over to the usa was edited often severely for content, And in the 90s people were not really believing in homosexuality as uncontroversial or accepted it to the level 2020s people do now; it would be more like a kids show promoting polyamory.

Anime adaptation then was mostly excising adult content, and the main argument against lightyear is more that having a kiss between husband and wife in a film for kids may not even be necessary at all; its sort of like having boyfriend and girlfriend in one.

These were people who bought series from japan for a quick buck and hastily localized them to cash in on children's programming, and Sailor Moon was brought by ""Do it Cheap"" DIC who generally didn't put much effort into anything.

I really doubt it was propaganda; 4kids for example also heavily edited anime series, ruining the Vision of Escaflowne for one, because they had to deal with a mature series in a young kids time slot.

It would be a little odd to use the word propaganda to describe the encouragement of a behavior that was considered natural but even if you overlooked that they could just say ""who cares?"" The issue they have isn't that it's propaganda it's that it's propaganda that goes against what they consider natural and therefore best for humans. so they really would have a lot of options out of this,

Either

1. it's not propaganda since humans just naturally like straight stuff because they are all naturally straight.  So it wouldn't count as propaganda since it's not trying to persuade someone, its merely aligning with what humans already like.

3. It is propaganda for something that is good, and it needs to exist because the gay propaganda is tricking their children into turning gay.

Or consider Blues music. It also has to be very specific.

If you change it too much, it's no longer considered Blues music. If Reggaeton doesn't have that beat, I'm not sure if it's even considered Reggaeton anymore.

The big difference between pop music and all the other genres is that popular music is a modern invention that combines traditional folk genres. You take the musical traditions from a variety of different groups of people from around the world, and mix and match them until you get something new.

Proof by contradiction complete.

---

...what? This is precisely the proof that natural numbers (and thus real numbers) do not form a finite set as you claim.

Either they're an infinite set (with the axiom of infinity) or they're a proper class (without it), but they're never a finite set.

---

&gt; There are injective sets to it (Integers, hypercomplex and so on), thus it can't be infinite.

By ""injective set to a set S"", you mean ""a set T such that there exists an injective function f: S -&gt; T""? The existence of such a set T certainly does not imply that S is finite, at least not under standard axioms (I mean, trivially, the identity function on S itself for any infinite S would do).

&gt; And you are going against the 5th postulate, how can one be larger than its parts?

You want to maybe try formalizing *anything* in this thread about abstract mathematics? It would help us explain to you the many and varied ways in which you're wrong.

The only ""fifth postulate"" I can think that you might be referring to is the parallel postulate, which has absolutely nothing to do with what we're talking about.

---

&gt; There can exist an injective function using C (or its subsets) as a codomain and R as a domain (or vice-versa)

Yes, there is such a function. We can construct a bijection explicitly. Consider the following functions:

* f: R -&gt; (0,1) given by f(x) = 1/(1+e^(x)). It's easy to see f is bijective.

* g: C -&gt; (0,1) x (0,1) given by g(a + bi) = (f(a), f(b)), bijective because f is.

* h: (0,1) x (0,1) -&gt; (0,1), given by taking the digits in the two inputs and interleaving them.

Then the function f^-1 composed h composed g is a bijection from C to R.

&gt; , thus R can't be infinite, since it doesn't contain C.

...what?

You're saying that the existence of an injective function f: S-&gt;T implies S is necessarily finite?

&gt; If R is infinity, then a set that contain all elements of R and C is also infinite

Yes, R union C is an infinite set, correct. (It happens to have the same cardinality as both R and C.)

&gt; since its parts can't be greater than the whole

The parts *aren't* greater than the whole. |R| &lt;= |R union C| and |C| &lt;= |R union C| (they happen to be equal).

---

That is true for finite sets. It is not true for infinite sets. (Actually, under standard set theory, you can *define* an infinite set as a set with a bijection onto a proper subset.)

Consider the set of natural numbers N and the set of natural numbers without the number 1 (call it ""S""). Then it's easy to construct a bijection f: N-&gt;S - it's just f(n) = n+1. So, by definition of cardinality, |N| = |S| despite the fact that S is a strict subset of N.",2022-07-10 21:45:27,2022-07-10 23:14:52

First, in your system, children and people with disabilities just die through no fault of their own, as do people who are simply unlucky but would otherwise recover and contribute to society. Humans as a group will most likely never be willing to accept this.

Second, it's completely unworkable without irreparably damaging our freedom and privacy. What would happen to someone who can't be identified under your system, like someone who is mugged and left unconscious without any documents? Your options are either that they are left to die, or that they are required (under threat of literal death, given the stakes) to have some unremovable, government-provided form of identification literally attached to their person. Are you okay with the government chipping or tattooing a barcode on everyone? Even then, it could get damaged and the problem would remain. On top of all of that, there are times when literal seconds count and taking the time to check if they can pay before treating them would cause people, even those who can pay, to die.

As another example, if there is an accident and someone gets a life-threatening injury that they can't pay for, do they have to wait until fault is determined before they can get treated? 

Third, one of the major drivers of prices in the United States is a reluctance to pursue care until it is an emergency, as we refuse to cover anything that isn't. Routine care and preventative maintenance are vastly less expensive than emergent care. Your change would drive a greater number of people to only seek emergent care, as those without insurance (perhaps they can't afford it) would have to ration their costs. It would put an immense and unreasonable burden on people to predict the cost of their care, and I would argue that this task would be essentially impossible, especially for those who would be most likely to have to do it.

Finally, it's not like health insurance companies are actually good, at all. Their entire business model is to try to weasel out of every possible charge. What happens to people if their insurance won't cover a procedure that they actually need, at least not without a fight? They just die while waiting for the insurance to approve necessary care because some algorithm somewhere decided that the expected cost exceeded the expected income from that customer? You'd also be adding a massive incentive, by your own admission, in favor of health insurance companies, which would inherently drive up insurance prices, by an unknowable but presumably large amount, as they could literally threaten you with death or disability if you fail to purchase coverage.

ifqqur5,pro-frog,"You say high status people like celebrities or the wealthy are the sort people instinctively want to love, but in your conversation with u/hashtagboosted you say it's not just because of their social status or success - it's the ""perception of someone's life competency and genetic quality."" So in order to disprove your statement we need to find examples of people who give compassion, care, and respect to people who are perceived by that individual to lack life competence or genetic quality.

But if people provide those examples, you suggest that they are not ""self-aware"" enough to know that they are not giving true compassion, care, and respect.

So I'll attempt to break down my own experience as a social worker to a more objective format. All of my clients are on a housing program - they are unable to make rent payments without government assistance. Most are not individuals I would go to for life advice, and many are fighting just to keep their lives together. They have competencies, but I would not consider many of them to have general life competence (though the reasons for that go far beyond the idea that they simply have genetic or personal failings).

-It is my job to give them respect. If they set a boundary, I respect it. Even if they don't want to pursue a resource I think would be wise for them to pursue, I don't push and I don't judge. There's always a reason someone doesn't want to try something that seems obvious, so it's clear that they know something I don't. I do my best to get the information I need from them about their progress without making them uncomfortable, and I seek to do the best work I can for them without crossing my own personal and professional boundaries. You could argue I do all that for the sake of not losing my job, but as you've said there are plenty of people in this field who are successful without showing respect. And frankly, if my workplace condoned disrespect to clients - lack of follow-through, disrespectful language, pushing solutions the client is disinterested in - I'd find a new workplace, because I know that approach is ineffective and cruel. I have zero people in my life who would know the difference between me working at an agency like that vs an agency like mine, so I don't do it for external validation.

-I show compassion. I'm not sure how to express this other than saying it outright. The people I speak to are dealing with challenges that are incredibly trying. I've cried with clients before about what they are struggling with. Acting neutrally and dispassionately in the face of that vulnerability would be cruel. And outside of the struggle, I'm interested in the other things they have going on in their life - their pets, their hobbies, their families, their likes and dislikes. They are real people who deserve compassion.

-I care. The first client I had who lost his housing kept me up at night for weeks thinking over anything I could've done differently, wondering where he was, how he was doing. I still do. And I do my best not to let it affect me, but I can't pretend it doesn't sting if a client I have rapport with loses their temper at me or says something insulting. It doesn't affect my work but it does mess with my head, because I care about what they think of me. Their thoughts and feelings matter, both independently of me and as they relate to me.

If this isn't an example that contradicts your point, exactly how would my work be different if it did? What more are you looking for? How could your view be changed?",2022-07-11 09:52:48,2022-07-11 09:52:48
ifr1eeq,ipulloffmygstring,"You're looking at two different things. 

There is the moral question of whether being a hunter/gatherer is more respectful to nature and more ethical than a modern society vegan. 

And then there is whether or not a global society of hunter/gatherers is more sustainable than a global society of modern vegans. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reality is that a hunter/gatherer lifestyle would require a lot more land and resources than veganism for the more than 7 billion humans currently living on the planet. 

The only way we sustain ourselves as well as we do is because we grow our food resources in farms that concentrates a lot more food into a much smaller area of land vs what would naturally occure. 

If we were all hunter/gatherers and we were not producing those high yeilds from small areas of land with farms, we would quickly over-exploit what resources were there and many humans would end up starving to death.

You might have an argument that an ecologically sensitive hunter/gatherer lifestyle for an individual might possibly be more ethical than an average vegan lifestyle based on environmental impacts. 

But once you start considering whether or not the planet could sustain that lifestyle for all humans, the modern vegan is going to be more likely to both be ecologically ethical and fit in a world with 7 billion people living the same lifestyle.

Here is yet more to support the fact that experts have concluded that hunter/gatherers did over-exploit their resources and hunted some species to extinction:

Here is a quote:

"" For example, there is evidence that hunter-gatherers, although they probably consumed less than 0.01% of the net primary production (NPP) of their habitat (Boyden, 1992), contributed to the extinction of a significant part of the Pleistocene megafauna""

ifrgc0f,Tanaka917,"&gt;There are some who voluntarily spend time with and help people with very low social status scores, like helping people in need, the poor, the homeless, the intellectually disabled, the crippled, etc, but they're not driven by compassion and are instead doing this as a way to build up their own status, e.g. to look like a nurturing person who would be a high quality parent/sexual mate, or gain status in a religious community, etc. They might not have done the self-reflection to realise this though, as competing for status is so instinctive and spontaneus few probably think about how it effects our actions, and most people dislike learning about it too.

Mate I've volunteered a dozen or so times in my life. Very rarely and infrequently. Here's the thing. Specifically an old folks home and an orphanage. Almost no one notices, and even less care. In truth I was doing that shit and the only people who remember that are me and the old man in a retirement home who has not one family member. People so poor they need charities to live. That person does nothing for me as an objective standpoint. They are old people about to die and young people who will probbably never reach anything. The workers usually have better things to do than shower us with praise, the organizers stop by once a week/month and the outside world can't see me with x-ray vision. I gained nothing from that work not even a letter of praise/recommendation. If I had never done it my life would have been largely the same, minus some empathy and plus a lot of free time. Do some people use charitable behavior as a sttepping stone? Obviously. It's a good trick. But you probably don't hear about the 1000s of people who just do their charity work and move on because that shit isn't newsworthy.

&gt;The lack of compassion towards low status people in society. For example someone did a test/prank on YouTube where they pretended to collapse unconscious in the street wearing cheap clothes vs a suit. People ignored the first collaps but formed a crowd around and helped in the second. It very common that autistic or intellectually disabled kids are bullied and treated with disdain by adult teachers in school. Abusive therapists are also common in mental health support. Homeless people are seen as less valuable in general. The examples are endless and uniquitous in all societies it seems.

Can I see this video please? I ask because

1. I've seen similar and studies tend to indicate that people don't help when there are more people aand will more likely help when there are less people. It's called Diffusion of Responsibility. Basically if 1000 people see an accident, most won't call 911 because 'well someone is already calling them.' But when you see an accident with only 3 people you're much more likely to act.
2. I've seen a similar claim where someone said 'strangers would help a girl child faster than a boy.' The video they showed was in a park. The boy was sitting alone drawing and on the girl's turn she was crying. Obviously people would more likely help the child who looks super stressed out.

Therefore I want to see this video to be sure that there's no variables that heavily inform people's behavior.

---

&gt;Your answer about volunteering is indeed a bit confusing for me with my perspective, though I think it doesn't have to mean that I'm wrong if we are driven by instincts to do these things, even if no one is taking particular notice.

But you are. You didn't just say instinct. You said instinct to be noticed and climb up a social ladder. I am telling you for a fact that I didn't do that for selfish intent. I'm telling you that lots of people do it without expecting anything in return. 

You and I can't both be right. Either the majority of people do it to be selfish and climb up (as you say) or the majority of people do it to at least help others as much as themselves (as I say).

I mean the fact that people have died helping others that's pretty good proof that they do it for no benefit as death is the end of benefits. 

&gt;I looked but couldn't find the video. I'm aware of the effect you're talking about but in the video there was no noticable difference with how many people there were around. The effect you're talking about was noticable though, because in the example when he wore a suit it took a (short) moment before a couple people stopped to check on him, and after they did, a crowd quickly formed.  
  
I remember another video from a surveillance camera in some kind of waiting from where an old woman collapsed unconscious (not a prank) and the few other people in the room ignored her.

I'm not taking your word or it. Sorry. 

Not to be rude but people see what they wanna see. It's entirely possible you mis remember simply because you were expecting it. It's also a chance you didn't notice these things I asked about because you weren't watching. Your word isn't enough. I wanna see the originals

---

&gt;I think our instincts to raise status can make us do such things even when no one really notices, because it's instinctive and unconcious. Modern society is in many ways completely unnatural and, in meaningful evolutionary time, novel. Maybe during evolution we would pretty much always be around other people, in the hunter-gatherer tribe or village setting in which we evolved.

That doesn't make any sense. At all. If I'm doing something to raise status it has to be something others see and raise me up for as a result. In order to raise my status it has to be notices otherwise it does nothing. Your claim is essentially that I did it because I don't have any free will and just obey my body. That's such a far out claim that you need to prove it. 

&gt;If they risk death to help someone, I think the person in danger is either a high status individual or a child.

Once again, sometimes. Not always. The idea that no man has ever saved another man except for clout makes no sense whatsoever.

Honestly what'll change your mind. If you're just gonna say all the examples I gave are just someone doing something for status and failing to get it you have to prove that. What do I have to do to change your view

---

&gt;Seriously though. an example of someone feeling genuine compassion for an obvious low status person would be a strong argument against my hypothesis.

 But like I said. It almost never makes the news because it's not considered special. 'man does charity work for free' isn't a headline, it's a thing that happens. It wouldn't be worth the time to print. 

&gt;About free will, I think humans do a lot of things subconsciously. But I don't know, I could be wrong about that.  


So theres 2 layers to this. Reflex and ideas

1. Reflex is well founded. If I poke you with a sharp stick you reflexively move away from the pain. 
2. Thought is also well founded. This is the ideas we don't even really know we have because they are so normal for us.

But you haven't proven that your idea fits in either. For the first it's so instinctive and short that there's no way I spent hours in that state; it's meant to be an auto response in a single moment. For the second I'm unconvinced that 1000s of people think volunteer work raises their status. They could literally just spend all those hours working to try impress  their boss. They don't need charity to look impressve .

What I disagree with is an implicit view that you hold there. Your view is that the comic itself *doesn't agree with you.* And I think the comic does. The question of whether Batman is as crazy as his foes comes up a LOT. The fact that he's wildly maladjusted and that he is flat out damaged goods is central to his character. Him being Batman might do some good, but it also does some bad. And it's absolutely *not* the best solution to the problems that he would like to solve. 

That is a fundamentally broken feature of Batman/Bruce Wayne. It is a severe character flaw that he struggles against as an individual. And I would argue that it is not a problem with the story.

I think if we're staying ""in the same universe"" (as opposed to doing a reboot ground up with a new interpretation) it's probably best to keep race aligned with the characters we know - we are afterall very race aware.  

This isn't to say that frodo can't be black, it's to say that once he is black or is white then changing that is a change, because we're caught up in race.  Ditto for obvious family members and things like that.  Similarly, if we started with black frodo instead of white frodo i'd expect frodo to stay black across in-universe depictions.  

Is it important to the story? No . Will it serve to distract?  I think so because we're race sensitive audience members and have been anchored in the universe to a character.

I think it'd be a bold option to make the chnages _knowing_ it would create a moment of dissonance and then be taking on ""righting a wrong"" from past inflexibility on casting, but I think generally the principle of ""find someone that looks like the last person who played the same character in this universe"" is a reasonable thing to want to continue.",2022-07-11 16:53:29,2022-07-11 16:53:29

There is a particular reason why some characters who are ""Race-changed"" are considered respected characters, like ""Black Spiderman"" and ""Female Thor"", and some are not like ""Black Frodo"".

It's to do with AUs (Alternate Universes) versus re-doing an established character. Miles Morales was enjoyed by the community not BECAUSE he's a ""Black Spiderman"" but because he was a new version of a character in a world that was made with different story elements in mind. Miles had a different upbringing than Peter, didnt have Peter's name, has different motivations, has different characters to deal with, etc. Same goes for Jane Foster and the concept of ""Female Thor"", she's a different character than Thor Odinson, different storywriting and characters relationships and motivations.

Making Frodo Black or of an Asian culture but doing nothing else with the character/world isn't what helps establish a welcomed diversity into an IP. How do you make an AU for an IP like LOTR?

Welfare isn't really for the protection of the poor. It's for protecting people *from* the poor.

He hates working, he's lazy, and he's a dick. He's had a few jobs, and he always ends up failing at them and getting fired or quitting within a week.

A dog’s predominant breed was determine by what owners were told by the agencies from where they adopted the dogs (that is, the stated breed of the dog). Blood samples were drawn from the dogs and submitted for DNA analysis. Results showed only marginal agreement between the stated breed of a dog and its genetic makeup. Dogs that were deemed to be a certain stated breed, based on appearance, did not have the genetic composition to support breed identity based on appearance. DNA analysis had concordance with a dog’s stated breed in only 25% of the cases. In 87% of the dogs, DNA analysis found a genetic basis for a prominent breed other than the stated breed.*  

Also, another problem with the statistics on bites vs breed is that larger/more powerful dogs do more damage and thus attack data is inherently skewed towards the large dogs.

Well, we actually do know that [the behaviour of different dog breeds is highly heritable](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.0716):

&gt; We found high levels of among-breed heritability for 14 behavioural traits (the proportion of trait variance attributable to genetic similarity among breeds).

---

&gt; My question though is does this prove that pitbulls are inherently aggressive?

There is no such thing as inherently aggressive or inherently any complex trait. We are all genes expressed in an environment. We all recognise that people's height is clearly mostly passed down by their parents, right? But if we starve the child of a tall couple, they won't be particularly tall. You can only discuss differences and how much of that difference is explained by genes and environment. What we can then say is that pitbulls are, on average, much more aggressive than most other breeds, and this is due, in large part, to their genetics.",2022-07-11 18:41:26,2022-07-11 21:07:57
iftgq7x,breckenridgeback,"'&gt; but the knowledge of evolution of English doesn't make me a better writer inherently

It absolutely does. Being able to invoke particular tones - whether modern or archaic - in your writing is a very useful rhetorical skill.

As an example, take the I Have A Dream speech, one of the most famous and impactful speeches in all of American history. You think MLK just shrugged and said whatever? No! He deliberately invokes the hell out of the exact archaic tone of the country's founding documents and of the Bible, in order to bring their gravitas into his cause. Look at this language:

&gt; Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation.

Why ""five score years"", and not ""a century""? Because he's invoking Lincoln, the guy whose statue he's standing in front of. (Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address begins with ""four score and seven years ago..."", which was archaic even in his time.)

&gt; No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.

[Amos, 5:24](https://biblehub.com/amos/5-24.htm).

&gt; I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.

Why not just say ""things will be nicer""? Because he's invoking [Isaiah 40:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040:4-5&amp;version=KJV) to a very Christian nation.

&gt; This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, ""My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.""

Patriotic songs. All archaic language, but archaic language that *means* something.

-------

Or, to draw on my own skill as a writer, let's compare a completely matter of fact snippet:

&gt; I think we should have more healthcare in America. It's bad that people can't afford it, because that makes them unhappy. In fact, I think our values as a country tell us that we have to help and support one another, and we especially have to do that for the most vulnerable.

Versus something like this, dipped into the fondue of American cultural symbols:

&gt; Thomas Jefferson once wrote of ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"". The order of those words is no accident. Life comes before anything else. It is the most fundamental freedom, the most inalienable right, of every American. The Constitution, too, does not forget its priorities. ""We, the people of the United States,"" it says, have a goal: ""to promote the general Welfare and secure the blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity.""

&gt; Without life, we cannot enjoy the blessings of Liberty. When Americans suffer and die, we have not promoted the general welfare. When we do not care for our own, we deprive them of the pursuit of happiness. Liberty cannot be only a theoretical thing, an abstract idea, it must be made as real and concrete as the Founders made it when they put pen to paper.

&gt; Our founding principle as a nation is to become a more perfect Union. We are one nation, under God, indivisible. And if we are indivisible, then we all must suffer as our most vulnerable suffer. ""Truly, I tell you,"" says Christ in Matthew 25, ""whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."" Would any of you today leave Peter to suffer from a preventable illness? Would you leave Paul without insulin? Would you have your savior walk on water with feet rotting from diabetes?

&gt; No, I say, you would not. No, I say, I would not. It is our right, and our duty, as Americans to rise to this national challenge. It is time to deliver our nation from the rider on a white horse, whose name is Pestilence, in the name of our Founders, and in the name of our God.

Do you believe it's eugenics if you don't want to date a person with a severe heritable disability? Is it ""passively"" eugenics to allow people to *choose* not to marry and reproduce with such a person?

---

&gt;Yes

Except, again, it's missing a key aspect to eugenics: the desire to change the gene pool.

I do not want to date a person with a severe disability because I don't have the income to care for increased medical expenses, I don't have the emotional bandwidth to be a caretaker, I find a lot of disabilities result in an unattractive appearance, and my hobbies/plans are incompatible with severely reduced physical capability.

However, my choice means that disabled men around me have a higher chance of failing to find a partner, removing their contribution from the gene pool, even though I'm not trying to stop them from finding love.

&gt;No. Because I could choose and marry to reproduce with another person for reasons unrelated.

But if it's *legal* for people to use the reasons I used above to reject a partner, then you ""open the door"" to ""eugenics"" (again, this isn't actually eugenics, there is no intent to alter the population, just personal preferences) as much as abortion does.

---

&gt;To use a legal term, there is general intent, but not specific intent. People aren't deliberately trying to delete a genetic trait, but that is the result.

And that is a *significant difference*. If your intent was to kill a man, but not to kill him based on his race, you committed murder but not a hate crime. If your intent was to shoot a gun but not to aim at someone, you committed manslaughter not murder.

*Eugenics* requires *significant intent.* The intent to alter the gene pool to improve society.

And unless you believe that it ought to be illegal to allow people to specify that a person's heritable disease is the reason they don't see them as a potential partner, you are supporting (your version) of eugenics as much as being pro-choice does.",2022-07-12 00:41:52,2022-07-12 01:32:46

But *it can be*. You can use contraception while you are having sex with genetically undesirable partners, and stop using it when you are having sex with a genetically desirable partner. 

You might say that it's rare, or that you don't want that to happen, but by allowing contraception, you are *opening the possibility to that*.

Also:

Nazi sterilizations and exterminations also weren't done on a genetic basis, because genetic screening wasn't invented yet.

Most pro-choice folks are not in favor of that. So accusing them of being ""pro-eugenics"" is unreasonable. In reality, they're pretty much all anti-eugenics, they just happen to think that other concerns outweigh this one and that therefore on the overall balance, abortion should be allowed.

This isn't specific to abortion. Here's a couple examples of other things that people might be in favor of despite the fact that those things do come with negative consequences:

Someone in favor of good privacy might be in favor of strong end-to-end encryption for chat-programs, voice-calls and video-calls. The existence of such secure communications that nobody can wiretap does however inevitably also benefit people who use them for nefarious purposes such as for example terrorists and criminals.

Someone who is in favor of NOT having cameras in changing-rooms can't reasonably be accused of being ""pro-rape"" (even though the absence of cameras might indeed in a given situation benefit rapists)

Someone who is in favor of allowing ordinary citizens to own guns, can't reasonably on that basis be accused of being ""pro-murder"". 

Common for all of these (and many more) situations is that someone is in favor of a given policy because they think that in sum total the benefits of that policy outweigh the drawbacks.

ifu6g02,ralph-j,"&gt; Eugenics is the practice of choosing good genes for reproduction and/or discouraging bad genes for reproduction.

But not on an individual level. The goal of eugenics is to change the quality of genetics of an entire population. It is exclusively done on a large scale, enforced at the state level, based on ideas of what an entire population (or race) should be like. Abortion on the other hand, is based on a personal case-by-case decision, with the goal of avoiding hardships in one's own family. No one is forced to abort their baby if a certain characteristic is detected, and there are plenty of people who bite the bullet and have their baby despite major health deficiencies. Individual abortions do not conform to any common definition of eugenics.

Secondly, pro-choice doesn't include any desires or preferences as to whether women should have abortions, or in which circumstances. Most people who are pro-choice actually want as few abortions as possible. Most women who want abortions will have abortions regardless of whether they are legal, even if it forces them to do it using crude methods in a back-alley setting, or using questionable internet medication. The main pro-choice concern is primarily about making sure that **IF** women want abortions, they have access to them in a safe and responsible manner, carried out by a doctor. That also makes it incompatible with eugenics.

---

&gt; I don't think it needs to be enforced at the State level. The entire population is being changed in Iceland at least. 

Eugenics is an intentional effort to change the entire population in a specific way, according to ideals that are decided centrally.

You can't decide that eugenics happened by looking at a before and after of a population. Eugenics is about intent, not effects.

&gt; Does it really matter if its being done by a doctor or not? 

Yes of course, if you don't also want women to suffer or die, *on top of* the deaths of the fetuses that you are not going to meaningfully prevent anyway.

&gt; If the abortion is happening, the life is ended, regardless of who is doing it.

Sure, but no one is deciding *for them* what their criteria for their own private abortion decisions should. That's what makes it different from eugenics. Should a family be happy with accepting the hardships that come with those babies, they are just as free to go down that route. Under a eugenics policy or regime, that wouldn't be allowed.

---

&gt; That much is true, but I still think its eugenics, even lacking the specific intent and government regime.

Then it looks like you're using the word in some kind of alternative/novel way, which is not how it is used by any authoritative sources, or even by ordinary language users.

I'm not trying to assume bad faith here, but it sounds a lot like you want to be able to call it eugenics just to be able to condemn abortion more impactfully. *It's not just murder, it's eugenics...*

---

Even if you accept consequentialism as a moral theory, it does not mean that you can simply apply terms that typically require intent, to situations where there wasn't intent. For example, a consequentialist couldn't simply conclude that all homicide are murder (instead of manslaughter) just because their moral worldview typically doesn't care about intent.

Even in the most charitable reading of your argument, you could at best describe abortion as *resulting in some incidental/unintentional form of eugenics*, although that's still a contradiction in terms.

I'm calling it incidental, because of course abortions are going to be more frequent in cases that are known to disproportionately result in family hardships.

While I'm not an expert on Australian tax law, that is probably not how it works.

Typically, you charitable tax deductions reduce your taxable income by the amount of the deduction - if you donate $1,000 then you get to reduce your taxable income by $1,000, thus not paying tax on it.

In this case, for the supermarket to claim the deduction, they would have to first claim the money you donate as revenue _and then_ take the deduction once it is donated.  So, if they get $1M in donations, they would claim $1M in revenue and then make a $1M charitable donation, thus washing it all out.   Conversely  - and more likely - they never claim it as income and just pass it through to a charity, but then they _aren't_ making a donation themselves, so there is no tax deduction to take.

There's multiple types of non-capitalist economies - [market socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism), [state socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_socialism), [ParEcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics), [distributism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributism), etc. Of course this is all tangential to the larger point - I was less concerned with capitalism vs communism and more concerned with your willingness to change your mind based primarily on tone.

On the other hand, we are having a calm, rational discussion on the internet and I have just exposed you to several ideologies that you were previously unaware of. Do you imagine a conversation about communism in real life, with the average person, would have gone as smoothly?

One benefit that the internet offers is that it is *very* easy to find people who know things that you don't know. In real life you would be limited to the knowledge of the people around you, which can create a powerful echo chamber. On the internet, you MIGHT hang out with people who are similar to you, but at any point you can CHOOSE to find people who have knowledge that you lack.",2022-07-12 10:53:01,2022-07-12 11:33:19

ifwaq0a,ralph-j,"&gt; Marriage between two minors: while this is generally not exploitative, it is still a terrible choice. If someone is barely old enough to drive, why should they be able to enter into something as serious as marriage? Marriage should take a lot more thought and consideration than a 16-year-old is capable of. As well, what's the harm in waiting a few years? 

I think there should be at least one exception: the current minor is close to becoming of age, but is expected to have only a few months left to live (e.g. due to a very serious illness), and their dying wish is to marry the love of their life.

In many countries, the law permits a court to make a compassionate/humanitarian exception in such cases, to fulfill such a person's deathbed wish to marry the person they love.

ifwb4wg,badass_panda,"&gt; Before I start, I am a woman in STEM and I wholeheartedly believe in science.

If you don't mind my asking, which discipline? I would approach discussing these concepts differently with a scientist than with an engineer, and differently with a mathematician than a computer scientist.

Before we get there, I'll avoid data and just couch it in general terms / logic.

From reading your CMV (and keep me honest if you don't think this is a fair representation), I can boil down your logic as follows:

* There's a problem with the idea that massive global warming must be caused by humans (that is, must be unnatural), because:
   * The earth is very old, and the climate has changed many times during the lifespan of the earth.
   * The earth is actually cooler right now than for most of the time that it has existed -- not only that, but it's warmed up in the past, many times, *without* human intervention.
   * Human activity has definitely put more CO2 into the atmosphere than was there before. However, while CO2 levels are correlated to the level of global warming, many factors can create global warming (and cause CO2 levels to rise in doing so). 

All of the sub-bullets are very reasonable here; they make logical sense. As is usually the case when you've got a chain of arguments that seems unassailable leading to a conclusion that most people disagree with, the problem is probably *further upstream,* with your basic premise (not the chain of reasoning you are launching off of it).

The vast, vast majority of climate scientists ([about 97%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus_on_climate_change#:~:text=97%25%20of%20the%20scientists%20surveyed,scientific%20evidence%22%20substantiated%20its%20occurrence)) believe that climate change is due in part or whole to human intervention -- but they use a very different approach than the one you presented. Generally, *this* is their chain of logic:

* Identify the factors that are predictive of global temperature levels during the period of data we have available to us (e.g., atmospheric density, atmospheric reflectivity, levels of volcanic activity, etc).
* Develop a mathematical model that uses these factors, and predicts what the global temperature will be throughout history -- and what it will be right now.
* *Now*, test this hypothesis: ""Under the current atmospheric conditions, changing CO2 levels by n% will increase/decrease global average temperature by y degrees.""
* This gives you a working, empirically validated model for how CO2 affects global temperature; you never get to ""prove"" something in science, the gold standard is being able to accurately predict what happens; when you can't, you need to change your theory.

So it's not, ""There must not be another reason the temperature could be going up,"" it's, ""We've mathematically isolated the role of CO2 in global temperature, and are therefore able to attribute changes in temperature to changes in CO2.""",2022-07-12 12:40:07,2022-07-12 12:40:07

I agree that people often use it to describe socially constructed problems, but all common sayings are misused and so not really a strong argument in my opinion.

I mean, that seems really difficult to measure. Do you mean all parents? Most? Yours? 

My parents did use mental health as a lease for lots of this stuff (many people in my family had issues and even some suicides) so I feel like it was well used for me. 

I often heard it used in the context of kids sports. Like “why is that little shit Billy better then me a soccer when I am in 7th grade and he is in 4th”, “well life isn’t always fair. He might just be better then you at soccer”. 

I have to be honest, this seems more like a complaint then an actual “change me view”. The thing you are complaining about is to imprecise to adequately argued about. 

If you could prove (and I do mean PROVE) that 90% of all instances of this advice being given by parents was in the context of socially or economically constructed unfairness, then you would be correct (I’m my view) if it is like 20% then I would say you are wrong and just complaining about a minority of cases. 

There is literally no way that I know of get at that information, so I am not sure how precise an argument can even occur.

Again, as a bipolar person genetics are quite unfair, whether you think so or not.

And if I was a parent, I would probably say something closer to ""i wasnt trying to be fair"" and that's because there is a fundamental power imbalance with being a parent. If I was being fair to my kid and treating them with the respect that any human deserves, then that would bar me from being able to physically remove them from a restaurant when they are screaming. It would bar me from controlling what TV they watch, what they eat, when they eat, who they see and when. This is like pretty basic stuff that all parents have some level of control over, and if they were treating their kids fairly, from one human to another, they would not have control over any of that. Would you tell an adult ""you MUST eat your peas and carrots tonight or no TV!""? I sure wouldn't.

Wait let's lay some ground terms here. ""Appropriate use of authority"" and ""genuinely unfair for a child"". I argue these are NOT mutually exclusive and actually overlap pretty heavily. A violation of ANY humans bodily autonomy IS unfair in my book, if you disagree, we can focus on that. Note its quite commonplace for parents to violate the agency of a child on a daily basis (under the correct pretense that this violation will cause the child to not be a spoiled brat who gets what they want all the time). 

Additional, the situation you described is pretty real-to-life. Look at how you get different outcomes due to socio-economic status.

Vanguardism is the mechanism that revolutionaries use to insulate their movements against internal counter-revolutions and external geopolitical manoeuvring.

I'm not sure what you mean here, the leaders of the USSR before Stalin took over (Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Kalinin, etc) did **not** believe that what they achieved then was their final objective (communism), only a step in the revolution that would eventually lead to communism in all of the world. 

If there were people that on the inside believed or had a change of opinion that the USSR they got was actually better than communism that's entirely possible but the whole idea of Marxism which is what Bolsheviks based themselves on was that for communism to be achieved there first must exist an intermediate system called the dictatorship of the proletariat that would first completely defeat capitalism, undo the superstructure that allowed capitalism to continue existing (religion, classes, nations, castes, etc) and then undo it's own structure to allow communism (which is a stateless system) to take over. The USSR was the Bolshevik implementation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, either because it's leaders preferred to keep themselves as leaders of that dictatorship instead of working towards communism or because the USSR was unable to achieve it's intermediate objectives of defeating capitalism and undoing the superstructure (both things which were likely equally true, neither the leaders seemed to want to leave their posts and the USSR didn't seem capable of fighting capitalism head to head) the USSR ended up failing in it's final objective of achieving communism.",2022-07-12 15:30:37,2022-07-12 17:05:31
ifxe5pb,Tenuous_Fawn,"At the end of the day, in the eyes of the government, marriage is just a legal contract where two people agree to share their possessions, file taxes together, etc. It is my view that it should be possible for two people with zero romantic attraction to each other whatsoever to marry, just like any other regular contract.

Parents are allowed to make other contracts on their child's behalf. What reasoning do you have for this one to be special? If you want, you can outlaw underage sex. That seems pretty reasonable to me. But to government, marriage does not imply a requirement to have sex, which is why I think it's best to separate the two.

The benefit of allowing underage marriage with parental consent is that it doesn't impose on our freedoms because of some association of marriage with romance or sex.

---

I'm going to attempt to change your perspective on this. I've noticed across this post that you seem to be tackling this issue from a utilitarian perspective. While I can't comment on utilitarianism as a whole, I will say that it doesn't make sense to look at marriage through a utilitarian point of view because the people that are by far most affected by marriage are the two people getting married, not the rest of society. This is why I believe that in this case it makes more sense to place value on individual freedom than general good to society.

Continuing that chain of reasoning, it doesn't really matter what *most* people think because *most* people aren't at all affected by someone marrying at 16 or 17. If society has a problem with someone marrying that young, then too bad for society. The important thing here is to separate the will of society from the will of government, just like Twitter can cancel someone for saying the n-word but the government can't throw them in jail.

16-17 years are already taxed on their income since they work, so it's not hard to imagine a situation where two 16-year-olds would want to get married and file jointly. That being said, according to my argument, the reason people get married is not really the government's business in the first place.

16-year-olds might be unprepared, but that is true of many people no matter their age. Just because *some* 16-year-olds are unprepared doesn't mean that it makes sense to put a blanket ban on all underage marriage. There are perfectly mature people at 18 who are perfectly content with their marriage, so I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a significant portion of 16-year-olds to be mature enough. I think a parent is a lot better at determining their childrens' readiness for marriage than a politician anyways.

---

A child may have poor decision-making skills, but a parent doesn't. At least, that's what the law seems to think. So just like a parent signing a release of liability for their child's field trip, a parent can allow their child to form a marriage contract. Now, you and I may disagree over whether or not government paternalism is justified, but I hope that you at least agree that parents letting children get married is not contradictory or hypocritical.",2022-07-12 15:43:24,2022-07-12 17:08:37

Without religious implications, can you explain why you think marriage is ""so serious"" that they shouldn't be allowed to get married. It's not like they can't get divorced, if it doesn't work out - it happens all the time.

---

&gt; Divorce can be messy, complicated by social pressures, etc. It’s also a tough decision to make. Oftentimes people in a bad marriage don’t divorce and suffer in the relationship. A marriage not working out is a consequence that we should try to avoid


These are all true for just relationships in general. You think there aren't a multitude of people in bad relationships that just won't get up and leave? It happens all the time. The things that make divorces messy would make any break up messy. 


As for a positive reason for why 2 17 year olds should be allowed to marry, an easy one is if they have a kid together. If they aren't married the mother would be using her maiden name on the birth certificate. If she wanted her child to be able to grow up knowing their parents were committed to each and all that - why shouldn't she be able to? 

If they split up, it'd still be messy, complicated by social pressures, etc. It's also a tough decision to make. 

Again, without a religious/moral objection, all you're basically left with is break ups suck.

Part of that is that we're coming from a fairly uniform minority culture where there were fewer things to iron out, not to mention that we didn't let physicality get in the way of the decision.

ifyfvx9,Slinkusmalinkus,"The reasons for marriage are:

* Tradition/Aesthetic Preference

* Financial/Tax/Insurance Benefits

* Legal benefits

* Possibly others?

Based on these benefits, I will give you a counterexample under the premise that the only exception you are currently allowing for is in the case of terminal illness.

**Next of Kin:** Suppose John (17) and Jane (16) are in a serious, committed relationship. Unfortunately, Jane lives in an abusive household. Her abusive parents are currently the next of kin for medical decisions and they would make decisions that are not in Jane's best interests if Jane were to be unable to make medical decisions. Conversely, John would make decisions in Jane's best interest were he to be her next of kin. Getting married would make John into Jane's next of kin. Since they are already in a serious, committed relationship, John and Jane would like to get married.

**Spousal Benefits:** John has joined the military and receives benefits, including room and board, healthcare insurance, and a pension. If John was married to Jane, then Jane could also be a beneficiary. Furthermore, Jane would be able to live with John, away from her abusive parents.

**Tradition/Aesthetic Preference:** John and Jane are both somewhat religious and believe in abstinence before marriage. Since they are already in a serious, committed relationship, and are already convinced of the practical benefits of marriage, marriage seems to them to be a natural next step into developing their romantic and sexual relationship in a way that comports to their beliefs.

John and Jane are already at or over the age of consent (16). John is old enough to join the military (17). Jane is old enough to seek emancipation (16). What reason is there to for you to deny them a marriage license?

---

We could stipulate that her parents would sign off on her marriage. We could also stipulate that if they didn't she would then seek emancipation such that she could then be married without their permission.

---

The way parents are abusive varies and the expectation of marriage is relatively common in christian families. Perhaps that lays outside your lived experience but I'm sure that many can attest to having been in or witnessing the sort of household that is, on the one hand, abusive, and, on the other hand, happy to see their duaghter marry (especially to a military man).

Why not wait? Benefits now are better than no benefits now:

* more suitable NoK

* Health insurance

* Tax deductibles and ability to file taxes together

* Legal benefits

* spiritual/traditional/aesthetic benefits

* mental health benefits

* etc.

Being emancipated does not carry the same benefits and may be harder, result in direct conflict with the abusive parents, lead to unwanted estrangement, etc. The outcome could be far more precarious for Jane's financial wellbeing and mental health.

Even if we stipulate that the parents would refuse on account of being abusive: it is also possible to bypass the need for parental consent for a minor to marry by seeking the intercession of a court. The extenuating circumstances of having abusive parents that would deny permission could be grounds for seeking such an intercession in which case the judge would be granting permission for the marriage.

It seems difficult to find good reason to deny people that both want to be married, subscribe to cultural beliefs that make marriage significant, and would receive practical benefits from partaking in the institution. All the objections I can think of for this sort of situation seem as though they would also apply to a nonmarital relationship, making me think that becoming married isn't really centred in those objections.",2022-07-12 20:59:11,2022-07-12 22:25:33

ifzgtya,destro23,"&gt; A sacrifice should be something that is sorely missed

Why is that your bar? In ancient times people would offer a plate of food from their family meal to the little shrine to Crom they had next to the hearth (which was eventually eaten by the dog) as a sacrifice, and Crom was cool with it. One, small, symbolic act of sharing your bounty with the gods was all it took to avoid disaster. At least until tomorrow's dinner. 

Sure, sometimes Crom demanded the blood of your enemies, and the lamentations of their women, but mostly he was cool with little offering to let him know you still feared him.

[Votive Offerings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votive_offering) have been present throughout human history. And that is all that not eating meat on Fridays is. A minor symbolic gesture to let god know you still fear him, and respect his commands. Catholics used to not eat any meat or dairy during Lent. During those times it may have been sorely missed. But, even then, only for the wealthy. The poor didn't eat much meat to begin with.

&gt;And only sacrifices that are hard on you can forge those attributes.

I fully disagree. Any willful act of obedience to the gods is pleasing to the gods. And, any act taken to live a life more fully in line with the particulars of your faith helps you to develop the inner virtues encouraged by that faith. 

You mentioned gratitude. Well, for a person who spends the entire year eating what ever they want willy nilly, having to not do that a few times a year ([and there are more days than you think](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1a4IIJ9dz0ob73LSfEX1_pF2hfTnfEKPilsdlNKhCjkNrGXiufYgS9RS46F1ZI7sf2E-mRomaqc5vdgCqZWCfLmKPXypZ2OozrQjloZ_SGSBM5_Z1_aqARtAq89nVzZSP2HYQFfbe3wgIXkhvwEaZy9m7E1oOCj1ouVP6w18ua3M-Pei_cK4/s1181/2022%20Traditional%20Catholic%20Fasting%20Calendar.PNG)) will encourage gratitude to god for the days when they can.

You mentioned humility. Well, imagine a committed Catholic going to an after work dinner at the steakhouse with his team, and having to eat a salad, and then perhaps defend his adherence to his faith in a public setting. Learning to do so with grace and without defensiveness is a lesson in humility. And, one that people would not otherwise have as many of our religious practices are invisible to others.

You mentioned charity for the less fortunate: but what better way to develop a deeply charitable mindset than by starting the habit of regular charitable giving? Every day you round up at the coffee shop for their ""Save the Goats"" campaign. Every week you send five dollars to starving kids in Alabama. Every quarter you donate to the Trevor Project. None of these are hard sacrifices, but they all for sure contribute to a charitable mindset.

&gt; Eating a mushroom pizza instead of a pepperoni pizza doesn't quite produce the same heat to forge that empathy.

But, produces more heat than eating the pepperoni without a second thought. And, that is pleasing to the gods. 

Take [this anecdote](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/5/4/985/htm) from Buddhism:

""On one occasion the Buddha gave a program for a king who had a tendency to overeating leading to slothfulness. The Buddha utilized the assistance of a family member. He instructed the king’s nephew at each meal to prevent the king from eating the last mouthful of food on his plate. The next meal consisted of just the amount that the king had eaten at the last meal, so that gradually the king had less and less to eat at each meal. The prince was given a verse by the Buddha to recite, if the king complained about being stopped from eating the whole plateful, reminding the king of the reasons for the program. In time the king was reported to have lost weight and re-gained his former vitality.""

In this case, the improvement in moral turpitude (decrease in slothfulness) was caused by the simple act of eating one less bite of food a day at first. And, it wasn't even a willing sacrifice; his nephew just manipulated him into being a better person. 

Empathy too can be cultivated by simple, easy daily acts of kindness. Even if they are only performative at first, and the person is not really enthusiastic about giving that extra 42 cents to the charity box, they still help to nurture a charitable mindset. And, from that chartable mindset, empathy can and will develop. ""“The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.” Great faith and charity can come from inauspicious beginnings. Jesus said it himself.

When you make it a rule that any sacrifice must be truly burdensome, then you are going to turn a lot of people off to the small sacrifices that people make every day to make the world a better place. If you tell people that god only wants grand gestures, then you are depriving god of the many small gestures that he has shown favor to for centuries, and you are depriving the world of countless acts of kindness that are done every day in the name of god.",2022-07-13 04:32:07,2022-07-13 05:46:10
ifzhd5g,VVillyD,"&gt; Back in ye olden times, the filibuster came with an extra ingredient: passion measuring. It was a stamina contest. To filibuster something required someone to actually stand up and discuss for hours until the other side got worn out.

But even this isn't true. On the rare occasions that just a single individual engaged in a filibuster it almost never actually blocked passage of legislation. When it DID work to block legislation it was always a coalition of Senators working together to trade off filibustering. There were always rules in place which allowed the filibustering Senator to hand off the floor to a like-minded compatriot to take over. They could temporarily yield for a question which ended up lasting 6 hours. Or they could defer to another Senator with more expertise, again, for an hours long continuation of the filibuster. Also, when these measures were used in a way which the rest of the Senate knew would allow the filibustering faction to delay endlessly they would still take regular recesses (allowing even more time for rest) at the end of the day/week.

The longest filibuster in US history lasted for 60 working days in 1964. During that time the entire Senate ground to a halt. Not a single bit of Senate business could be done for over 2 months. This is why the rules were created which led to the advent of the silent filibuster: to allow the Senate to continue on with other business until the filibuster was resolved. The silent filibuster was an unintended consequence of the Dual-Track Legislative Process. They should have just abolished it altogether at the time.",2022-07-13 05:50:32,2022-07-13 05:50:32
ifzrlnl,GivesStellarAdvice,"&gt; This has been distressing for me because now I feel like I'm constantly in a rush because now I am forced to organize myself, buy groceries, wake up an hour before work and prepare myself for the day,

&gt; For example: I have to step away frequently prior to breaks because I have a small bladder and it is difficult for me to hold it in for several hours. This is not something I can control. I even make sure to prevent drinking any fluids throughout the day to keep it on a low but I still gotta go regardless.

&gt; For example: venting off the phone is a common occurrence among call center agents because most callers are abusive (this varies a little depending on the industry) and usually you are not allowed to terminate the call when a caller is hurling personal insults at you because they can't take no for an answer. You have to sit there and take it.

Your complaints or concerns seem to be more directed at the way you are managed than at the fact that you're on a webcam.  The three I've picked out of your comments above have nothing to do with the presence of the webcam and everything to do with how your manager (might) react to the actions you described.

A good manager isn't going to care about bathroom breaks, taking a quick break to grab a snack or put a load of laundry in, or venting about a rude customer.  Whether they see those activities in person, on a webcam or are told about them by others doesn't matter.

So your complaints aren't really about the webcam.  Your complaints are about the way you're managed (or, because it's unclear from your post, your complaints may be about the way you *think* you're going to be managed, but you haven't given your manager the opportunity to show that they don't actually give a shit about any of those things).",2022-07-13 07:08:24,2022-07-13 07:08:24

People like to take risks, they like to believe that they are smarter, faster, stringer or whatever than the other people who are caught. There is a chance in their mind that they will get away with it and that's all that they need. 


It doesn't matter the severity of the sentence if you don't get caught. That is why having an effective system for solving these crimes is incredibly important. An almost guarantee of getting caught paired with lesser sentences is a better deterrent than a chance of getting away with it paired with a high sentence.

ig0tw07,McKoijion,"Remember when you were a kid in biology class and you learned about mitosis and meiosis? All living organisms originally started as unisex single celled organisms. They basically divided in half to create new organisms. Then they evolved to sexually reproduce. Instead of just dividing in half, so your offspring are basically clones of you, you partner up with another organism and give half your genes to them and they give the other half. That way you have more genetic diversity and your offspring are more likely to survive.

Humans are sexually reproducing multicellular organisms. We all start off looking the same, then we differentiate in the womb. That seam on the bottom of your balls? That's where what would have become your labia formed your scrotum. Your clitorus? That's what would have become the head of your penis. [Here's a diagram.](https://imgur.com/XL8l1ry) You can't see it, but similar stuff happens in your brain.

But say something goes wrong. You should have been a boy, but your cells aren't receptive to testosterone? You'll look like a girl. But then you hit puberty and you start cranking out dihydrotestosterone. Suddenly that little girl turns into a boy. They always were a male, but they didn't have the right signal to develop male genitals until they hit 12 or 13. This is just one example, but there are a bunch of other things like it.

Modern medicine has has advanced a ton, but society doesn't know how to deal with it. We're used to a world of boys, girls, and a bunch of inbetween people that end up being classified in one category or another. In the past, none of these people ever met each other because it applied to less than 1% of the population. But now they can go on the internet and find each other. Then they come up with a bunch of terms to describe themselves. There are a bunch of weird developmental issues that can make someone's phenotype (they way they look on the outside) not match their genotype (what their genes say they should look like). Hence people have come up with a bunch of nuanced terms to describe themselves.

Ultimately, no one is choosing to be straight, gay, trans, etc. Nature and a little nurture decide that stuff for you. You're just figuring out how to live with it. Ideally, you have an XY or XX genotype and a male or female phenotype and gender to match. That's the easiest thing to live with in society and it means you can have natural born children. If there's a mismatch, you just have to make do. On the children side, you can adopt kids and/or use various reproductive technologies to have children. On the societal side, you can just convince everyone to be more accepting of your medical condition.

As a last point, this is sort of a medical condition in that there's a clear biological cause. But being LGBTQ, having random genders, or whatever isn't really harmful to the person. If you have extremely white skin, it's a disease called albinism that makes your life difficult. But if you're just pale, it's no big deal. It's not a disease, just a variation from the norm. And as I mentioned before, the whole point of sexual reproduction is to increase the diversity of life. All these weird new genders aren't hurting anyone, including themselves. They're happy and people in society who have accepted them are also happy. Meanwhile, you're choosing to make yourself annoyed over something that isn't really a big deal. If you can get past all the straight person awkwardness, LGBTQ culture is actually pretty fun.

We live in a culture saturated with heteronormativity and heavily enforced cisgender roles. In all of my experience, trans people are aware something about them is different. In many cases that awareness is gender dysphoria. They're just so beaten down by society into thinking they're wrong. They suppress how they feel and hide away. 

No one is telling kids they *should* be gay or trans. All they're told is ""hey, straight isnt the only orientation, and your genitals don't inform your gender. You're allowed to be who you are deep down inside.""

ig11h69,StickyBraces,"I am sort of piggybacking off of /u/akoba15's comment, but I'll argue my point slightly differently.

I agree that in an ideal world, ""minors should not be able to marry under circumstances""; however, reality often differs from fantasy.

I will argue against your point that ""Allowing 16/17-year-olds (sometimes younger) to marry is completely illogical to me."" In fact, I argue the very opposite: that it is quite logical and intentional for those involved.

There is certainly potential for exploitation in both ""developed"" and ""undeveloped"" countries; however, I would argue that early marriages in undeveloped countries are often a result of the socioeconomic/material conditions in those countries and may thus be a calculated move attempted to be made (and sometimes succeeding in being) in the best interest of those involved.

I'll be quoting extensively from ""Ethnographie Empathy and the Social Context of Rights: 'Rescuing' Maasai Girls from Early Marriage"" by Archambault. You should be able to read a PDF online here. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41407519#metadata\_info\_tab\_contents](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41407519#metadata_info_tab_contents)

Archambault is an anthropologist who studies the Massai in Kenya.

Archambault argues that a lot of early marriages come about not because of patriarchal values, but because of material conditions.

She gives the example of Esther, whose father is a herdsman in Kenya. The average age of marriage in the area has recently decreased substantially. Why?

Archambault gives two reasons. First, pastoralism has become almost impossible economically.

&gt;There is a pervasive sentiment throughout the region that pastoralism is becoming much more difficult because of the combined forces of land and resource fragmentation and dispossession, which have been accelerated by recent land-tenure reforms, increased climactic instability, continued state neglect, and increasing population pressure.

Marriage is an important part of building community among different tribes of the Massai. When economic hardship comes along, this means that it will be more heavily relied upon for the survival of the tribes.

&gt;Given these growing constraints on pastoralism, residents of Enkop must turn to their social networks for protection of and access to resources - arguably more than ever before. Maasai lineage, clanship, age-set, and marriage systems provide an institutional foundation for these networks. In this light, and at the risk of sounding reductionist, the continued (or even heightened) importance of ""customary"" marriage in connecting families to pastoral resources now under individual title and providing strong links of mutual support and reciprocity must be noted.

Second, education is not always reliable. This means that marrying off one's daughters may actually be more beneficial for their well-being than going to school.

&gt;So although sending girls to school is the path that most parents in Enkop are choosing to secure the future well-being of their daughters, the risks of dropping out and uncertainties related to whether or not formal education will lead to livelihood security make it less of an obvious choice than the human rights discourse suggests. In this light, choosing early marriage may be understood as a decision taken by parents who have lost confidence in the education system or in the economy or who do not trust their daughters' future to the hands of the state. So, contrary to popular belief, early marriage may be more effectively understood as a modern adaptation - a decision made not out of a ""deeply rootedcustom"" and ""patriarchy"" but, rather, out of love, concern,and insecurity.

Now clearly, I'm not arguing that this is an ideal situation. In fact, quite the opposite. Socioeconomic and educational opportunities need to improved in Kenya and hopefully we will get to a point where early marriages do not happen. That won't happen, however, without a nuanced understanding of the economic exploitation that leads to early marriages and attacking the core of the problem at its root.",2022-07-13 12:06:41,2022-07-13 12:06:41
ig17hde,rockman450,"&gt;since Allah just means God in Arabic

This is accurate, if you're speaking in Arabic, you would say Allah no matter your Judeo, Christian, Muslim affiliation. 

If you're an English speaker and you use the word ""Allah"" to reference your deity, most likely you are Muslim or you are trying to be ironic/funny or sarcastic.

---

In English, the word for God is ""God""... it's not Allah. 

So, if you're an English speaker and you're referencing God, the word would be ""God"". Unless you're being ironic/funny or making fun of Christians, Jews, or Muslims. 

If you're speaking English and you're seriously calling your deity ""Allah"", it's more likely that you're Muslim. 

If you're speaking English and speaking of your deity, you would say ""God"" if you're Christian or Jewish or ""Yahweh"" which is the Hebrew word for God (the language the Bible/Torah was written)

---

You're asking really good follow-up questions, I appreciate that. Thank you. This is a sensitive topic. 

Muslims pray in Arabic no matter their native tongue. They'll call their deity ""Allah"" as this is the word in their religious language for the deity. While the Quran has been translated to other languages, the required daily prayers are still in Arabic across the Muslim world. So, because they constantly use ""Allah"" in prayer to worship their deity, they use that same word in conversation/discussion in their native language - though sometimes with different pronunciation - emphasis on the first or second syllable. Also, it's important to note that the word ""Allah"" is the word in the Quran for the deity even when translated to English.

Christians did not use the native language of the Greeks (New Testament language) or Hebrews (Original Jewish Language), as they spread in the early 1-3 centuries - they translated into the language of the newly converted. 

So, for example, as Christianity spread into Europe, the word for the Christian God in Spanish was translated to ""Dios"", ""Dieu"" in French, and ""God"" in English so that the religion could be relatable rather than continuing to use the Hebrew word ""Yahweh"" for God across all languages.

If you are an English-speaking Christian, you'll use ""God"" or ""Yahweh"" to refer to your God as these are the translated &amp; original words for the deity of the religion.

However, if you're a Christian speaking Arabic, you would refer to the Christian God as ""Allah"" because this is the Arabic translation of the word ""God"" and Christianity is translated into native Arabic language.

I don’t want to have to worry about a boy s*xually assaulting/harassing my daughter(s) , I don’t want to have to worry about r___ either. I don’t want to have to worry about when she or they get older then will they be able to walk to and from school without being bullied by both boys and girls. 

Then there’s the fact that I don’t want my daughter(s) to be all promiscuous and teenage pregnancy. Also don’t want them to be in any kind of sex work. “Raise them right and you won’t have to worry” well you know the stereotype of the pastor’s daughter being a hoe ? I’m not saying all pastors are perfect or don’t do any wrong but pastors have some of the highest morals of anyone that I’ve seen &amp;&amp; I’m sure they raise their daughters right and again I’m not saying they’re perfect but some people live up to stereotypes.

Some of them are accurate. At least to me
I just listened to a Reddit video about a teen girl not knowing who the father of her baby is cause she slept around. No dad wants that for their daughter.

ig2kg7j,neotericnewt,"What you're saying is that a fetus should have personhood. That seems completely absurd to me when, as you noted, a fetus (the vast majority of the time) is incapable of any thought, any emotion, feeling pain, pleasure, or anything else. It does not have the necessary hardware for these things to exist. 

The ""potential"" to someday become a thinking, feeling person doesn't seem very relevant to me. Sure, under specific conditions that's true. Under specific conditions a sperm cell will become a thinking feeling person, but it's not, and there's a very good chance that will never happen. 

Why would an unthinking, unfeeling clump of cells be viewed as equivalent to a person? 

I'm also curious how consistent you are in your beliefs. If you were in a burning building and could save a woman or a petri dish with a fertilized egg in it, which would you save? Would there even be a moment of hesitation? Is there any doubt that you should save the thinking, feeling person with loved ones and relationships and who will suffer immense pain if she's allowed to burn to death? 

What if it were ten fertilized eggs? What if if were a hundred? 

I'm guessing the vast majority of people would save the woman, because the fact is, a fertilized egg isn't a person. That it potentially could be a person someday doesn't make it equivalent to a person.

Edit: I also just wanted to add, your reasoning for why people get abortions was pretty gross. People don't get abortions because they're worried about getting food cravings.

ig2oeqi,breckenridgeback,"&gt; I still feel really strong about my opinion that a fetus is basically identical to a baby, so I want to really educate myself since the only thing holding down my opinion of restricting abortion is where life really begins or if it's really worth pinching off that potential life for the benefit of your own. 

First of all, we should be careful with our terminology. ""Fetus"", as a term, refers to part (but not all) of the developmental stages during pregnancy. Prior to about the ninth week of pregnancy, the proper term is *embryo*.

So: simply put, an *embryo* - which is usually what is at issue in abortion, since the majority of abortions take place before nine weeks gestational age - doesn't have much of any of the traits that make a human a human. An embryo doesn't even have a brain stem (the very simplest bit of the brain that controls things like a heartbeat) until five weeks in. The folds of the cerebral cortex - the part of the brain in which you actually think - don't form until about twenty-five weeks.

Up until that point, a developing embryo or fetus doesn't really have any uniquely human traits. It's no more capable of thought or consciousness than very basic animals, and I assume you do not devote too much concern to the moral status of a mosquito or a shrimp.

Yes, it can develop into something more, but an embryo is no more a human than an acorn is an oak tree.

Worse yet, if it *is* a human, then you should be against all sex for procreation - because every embryo conceived has about a 1-in-4 chance of dying before it's born (actually a bit higher than that, since that's for *detected* pregnancies and many of them fail immediately).

&gt; I believe life is sacred and everyone gets one shot at it, and to have it cut off before you're even able to have a thought feels really fucked up to me personally especially if its for a reason that's purely ""selfish"", like body changes or food cravings. 

This is, to put it mildly, a very dismissive framing of the reasons people get abortions.

---

&gt; First of all I'd like to apologize, I am slightly neurodivergent so I do not see when I'm being offensive very easily 

Well, a good rule of thumb is to assume that people often have good reasons for making the decisions that they do, even if those reasons do not immediately occur to you. Dismissing someone's reasons for doing something as trivial, pointless, or too minor to justify their action is likely to offend. Doesn't mean it's *wrong*, necessarily, but it's likely to offend (and it *is* wrong here).

&gt; I'm just struggling to really grasp the whole picture, it still doesn't feel right to me to have to label when something is alive and when its just cells.

Embryos are *alive*, they just aren't humans on a moral level.

It's natural enough to want to put the world into neat boxes. But the fact is that the world just doesn't work that way. Fuzzy edge cases and lack-of-bright-line situations are very common in ethics. If they weren't, we wouldn't need to think much about it!

&gt; I'm still stuck on this mindset that all life is precious because we don't really fully understand life or death. 

Well, if it is, you've got some big changes to make to your life. It's a self-consistent enough moral philosophy, but it's certainly not an easy one. Almost everything about your life poses risk to some non-human creatures - even a vegetarian diet with modern farming kills large numbers of (say) rodents.

That doesn't make it wrong, by the way! It just means that if you find yourself applying a special standard in one area of your life that you don't in others, you should suspect there's some bias in your thinking.

&gt; ik its stupid but, I hate that I feel this way but Idk how to over this feeling that it's more selfish to prevent someone else from existing when its not their fault..?

I would argue you are a monster if you choose the embryos.

It might help to reframe it in your mind.  No one is required to give their body and organs to another human being against their will.  You cannot even be required to donate blood.  Abortion is the right of a person to not use their body as a life support machine and all the risks inherent to that.  The unintended consequence is that the fetus cannot survive removal.  But the *intended* action is that the woman wishes to no longer be pregnant.

If we could remove fetuses without harming them, a different discussion will need to be had, but we are not there.

Because it is impossible to guarantee that the mom would go through pregnancy with no long-term physical/mental effects.  Her body *will* be affected long term.  Her mental state *will* be affected long term.  She could die.  She could permanently damage her liver or kidneys.  Pregnancy is *hard* on the body.

Additionally, the hormones released during birth and immediately afterwards are designed to make you *want* to keep your baby, no matter how terrible it would be for you or the baby.  They are incredibly strong instincts and hormones.  That is how a lot of infants end up abused and neglected.  Once the hormones wear off a bit, they are bonded to the baby and there's severe social consequences for the baby being taken away.  And after they are abused/neglected, they are incredibly difficult to adopt.  So you are creating a child to be tortured.

And at this point in time, there is no way to separate a fetus and a pregnancy, so in many people's minds, they see no difference between the two.",2022-07-13 18:08:05,2022-07-13 19:43:56
ig3c0is,suspiciouslyfamiliar,"&gt; When I first got on the World Wide Web it was still the 90's and 4chan was still known for having the worst and best of all Trolling.

4chan launched in 2003

&gt;  You win when the other person calls you out or says you're a troll.

That's [this meme](https://www.lovethispic.com/uploaded_images/29513-What-Trolls-Want-You-To-Believe.jpg) in a nutshell.

---

But the whole concept (or defense of the concept, as you have it here) just seems... off. Look, when you say:

&gt; I feel like that practice helps to also weed out bad information that's presented as something else.

while actively advocating for an *increase* in trolling, you're advocating for more bad information clogging up the web. You say
 
&gt; t it's important for recognizing misleading information

but also:

&gt; Winning a Troll point can be very difficult if people are practiced at the game

So what happens when more people are trolling and more people are becoming practiced at it? Clearly, you'll then have some nightmarish and inane form of the internet where you can't trust *anything* you read.

I feel we're almost at that point as it stands, so we don't need *more* things contributing to this state of affairs.

---

&gt; You know you are being mislead.

Then you're not being trolled.

---

So you think it's a *positive thing* that we have to double-check every piece of information presented to us in case someone is trolling, rather than us building a base level of trust between ourselves as a species? 

I just don't see how this benefits us as a whole. It's like you';re saying ""people can be twats who lie on the internet, so let's all be twats who lie on the internet, so everyone can recognize when someone's being a twat who lies on the internet. Which is all the time.""

What's the *point* of all this?

---

But that's not how people define the word now - or even back in the 90s, to be honest. Wikipedia gives as good a definition as any:

&gt; In Internet slang, a troll is a person who posts inflammatory, insincere, digressive, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.), a newsgroup, forum, chat room, online video game, or blog), with the intent of provoking readers into displaying emotional responses, or manipulating others' perception. This is typically for the troll's amusement, or to achieve a specific result such as disrupting a rival's online activities or manipulating a political process. Even so, Internet trolling can also be defined as purposefully causing confusion or harm to other users online, for no reason at all.

---

But it's not some form of group learning, like you're making it out to be. It's someone coming in and disrupting things, so someone else has to *take the time* to point it out and set things straight. 

Which could have been avoided by someone *not trolling in the first place*.

---

Dude, it's only a game when everyone knows they're playing. And as discussed, if everyone *knows* they're playing, it's not really trolling. 

Someone posting on a suicide help board that they're depressed, and then mocking people for helping is also trolling. But who wants to play this game except for complete twats?

---

So your view is ""we should redefine a word that millions (maybe billions) of people understand means one thing, to better fir with my kind of idiosyncratic view of what the word *should* mean""?

How is that in any way reasonable? Why not just come up with a new word, or something?

---

How the English language literally works is the majority of people agreeing on a word's definition is how a word is a defined. What *you're* proposing is a top-down revision to the language, which is actually *also* how language works, but in places like China.

&gt; Do you not think there's a problem with misinformation?

We've already been over this. Your suggestion doesn't help. It makes things worse.

---

&gt; And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes, is touched, any time you touch a word, you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation, you verb it, you make the mobile move. You didn't break it. It's just in a new position, and that new position can be just as beautiful. 

It can also be shitty and pointless. If you accept one, you have to accept the other.. So no - ""trolling"" doesn't have to be redefined to fit your idiosyncratic definition. It doesn't mean *you* have to stop defining it as such. It just means you're going to get a lot of pushback and blank stares when you use it to mean something the majority of people don't agree with.

---

What if I said ""haha I was just trolling you teehee""

Would that make it alright?

---

So why did you get angry?

Sorry - are you saying a troll has to openly declare that they're trolling *before* they make a statement? Or that they say ""haha I was just trolling"" afterwards?

---

&gt; As long as it's labeled and declared you are wasting my time and energy but not everyone else's.

This doesn't answer my question - labelled *before or after* the trolling in question?

---

See, by this definition I don't understand why you can't just draw a distinction between ""trolling"" (being defined and viewed the way most people today use the word) and ""the game of trolling"" (what you want it to mean).

---

But maybe I was just trolling you when I declared I was trolling. 

See how this kind of thing can quickly get out of hand?

---

&gt; Nope, once you make a declaration you conceded the game

I'm jut playing with a different ruleset to you. Which is obviously still valid, based on your conception of definitions. 

And why can't I be playing two games at the same time - the second one beginning with the ""concession""?

---

But you can't set the rules and say other rulesets are invalid - otherwise games would never evolve. It's the same as language.

---

What happens when you misdeclare a troll?

---

I mean if you misdeclare someone a troll.

---

Right - OK. So what happens if you misdeclare ""a trolling"". Do you lose a point?

---

No, that was a different game. When you declared troll in [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vykjcm/cmv_the_game_and_rules_of_trolling_need_to_be/ig37wg8/), you were wrong. You lose a point. 

So, what have we learned from all this? How has our understanding of misinformation progressed?

---

But what have we learned here today?

---

&gt; You seem interested but not actually interested in the rules but not actually interested in reaching an accord or even trying to change my opinion.

...so what have you *really* learned about the value of your game?

---

But your biggest argument is that we should change our definition of trolling because it has *value* in identifying misinformation. 

But this whole thing has just been a diversion - a way to spend time. So how does the value outweigh the utility of the current definition?

---

So what do you think of my proposal that you revive ""the trolling game"" as a distinct and separate concept from the ""act of trolling"" as commonly understood? 

The distinction of specifically calling it a ""game"" is small, subtle, but very important.

---

Going back to check your OP, I saw your edit:

ig3htve,YogurtclosetTough610,"Why are there so many incest ones recently? haha.

From an evolutionary perspective people have a gut reaction because they are applying a heuristic. Incestuous relationships are risky. Mainly for health, which is probably the biggest factor as to why people think its weird. Biologically speaking you are here to procreate and you need to select healthy mate to create strong offspring. Selecting a family member is suboptimal, biologically speaking. We know this instinctually. So that translates to some sense of moral reasoning.

I think this also translates to gay relationships. It's mate selection. On average selecting your brother is kind of a bad choice (and weird obviously). It's probably bad for your tribe because you need new people coming in. It's better to look outside than in.

Since we are all bald monkeys and morality is just some instinctual sense of what is right and wrong then this is why it's morally bad.

---

No not really though. For starters evolution doesn't want anything. Secondly there are obvious rationally derived exceptions. But the problem with morality is that it's a broad strokes thing. A heuristic. A quick assessment to figure out if something is good or bad. We've evolved to do a lot of those.

It's like murder. Is murder morally wrong? Well yeah, but not in all cases. There are exceptional circumstances where it might be right. But does that exception make murder, as a whole, morally good or neutral? In my opinion no. If you polled the average person they will tell you murder is bad. It's because it is. 9 times out of 10.

Second, I'm not sure judges take the decision to deny bail lightly - why *wouldn't* Maxwell fleeing the country be a ""Threat to public order""? Can you imagine how furious people would be with that outcome? 

Third, even if we *do* characterize her time in detention as ""torture"", I'd still say the scenario I outlined in my previous comment outweighs the harm inflicted on Maxwell. And isn't this the crux of the issue? How exactly are you quantifying ""harm"" when it comes to psychological matters?

ig4qrie,College_advice12,"So I am autistic.

Despite having difficulties with growing up I now see it in a positive light and wouldn't change that aspect about myself.

Looking at your own references it also seems clear that you yourself would prefer this 'neurodiversity' model (though I'd even contest that these are seperate models)

&gt; The medical model looks at autism as a set of deficits or impairments. **Under the medical model, these impairments or differences should be ‘fixed’ or changed by medical and other treatments**, even when the impairment or difference does not cause pain or illness. The medical model looks at what is ‘wrong’ with the person, instead of what that person needs.

&gt; This model was developed by actual autistic people who had good reason, **they didn't want to be electrocuted in the name of ""cure""**.

If the disability model is superior then why did these people have good reasons to change the model? Seeking a 'cure' is the entire point of the disability model. Surely if autism is something that has to be fixed and nothing more they should seek that cure out using any means necessary.

&gt; Because autism is a personality trait now. Doctors are diagnosing everyone with autism now anyone who says they are lazy they are quirky...boom autism. I am TIRED of of seeing ""autistic people"" who are clearly not autistic.

Is it not more likely we've just gotten better at diagnosing it?

&gt; Disability model is superior because before we knew autism was a disability people in the past would still treat autistic people as person who is lazy or weird when actual they would've been disabled.

In the past there was evidence that people in Ireland outright killed autistic people for being autistic because they were convinced it would bring back their real and 'fixed' child.

In regards to the point of public perception I think that just comes down to personal opinion, personally I see public perception as leaning far too towards the low functioning side.

---

&gt; Partially because they are on the mild side of the spectrum

But this is the disability model. It is irrelevant where you fall on terms of severity, it is still a 'flaw' that must be fixed.

Someone missing just their foot is still disabled, just like someone who lost both their legs.

Since the disability model according to OP is superior then they should embrace the seeking of any 'cure' whatsoever for it.

---

&gt; But we know autism is not a curable disability

Well someone better tell all the eugenics fans that and the many many projects they currently have that are trying to 'cure' it.

&gt; But maybe in the future we may have but still I don't think it should be mandatory for everyone.

Why shouldn't it be mandatory. Again under your own definition of the medical model: ""Under the medical model, these impairments or differences should be ‘fixed’ or changed by medical and other treatments, even when the impairment or difference does not cause pain or illness.""

Since this model was superior in your eyes, and it's sole aim was to cure it, then what possible reason would there be to not make the cure mandatory and hand it out to everyone? To suggest we shouldn't cure everyone would be to suggest that the medical model is not the superior option.

---

&gt; Because we don't force people to get prosthetics if they don't want to.

You have a point in that regard, but such people are given great social pressure to do so. As are people with cancer or other diseases to fight against it.

In some countries as well such cures can be forced upon a person. For one example if a minor's legal guardians refuse treatment but a doctor decides it is better for the child's sake they can overrule the parents and do it anyway. Would you support a doctor curing someone of autism in this scenario? Do note that the child's opinion either way is irrelevant legally since they are a minor.

&gt; But I realize it is not a good comparison because is different to differentiate what is autism and what is the person.

This is true of any disability not just autism.

&gt; And it is not that simple to cure it.

Correct, but why then did anyone have 'good reasons' to move to a model that explicitly is not trying to 'cure' them of autism?

&gt; But it's clearly a disability and not just a variation

Again I disagree there is a distinction here, why can't it be both? As well as that how does that show the model your stating is superior here, is in fact superior?",2022-07-14 05:21:30,2022-07-14 07:27:52

ig5s9ar,analyticaljoe,"As a side note: Anyone who is getting worked up about how someone else identifies their gender is being an ass. No skin off my back if someone born a woman decides to represent as a man or vice versa. Just like if some dude decides to have sex with some other dude or some woman with some other woman. Go wild. Whatever gets you through the day. My cis male life is not in the least affected.

All of the labeling of ""unsound, dishonest, and dangerous to a free society"" apply to Senator Hawley just as easily here.

For example, when he says: ""No, I don't think so."" He is intentionally playing a semantic game with ""man"". He knows she means gender. He intentionally uses it as ""sex"" without explaining. If he didn't want a snarky reply, he should have answered in a more forthright way.

And I think it's completely likely that Senator Hawley does not actually care about people representing as a different gender, but he wants votes from a base that gets motivated about it. That sounds dishonest to me.

And ""dangerous to a free society."" Why choose this? I mean, dial up any Tucker Carlson episode and the danger is looking way higher. This exchange is milquetoast by comparison. But even lensed in at this conversation, she's not behaving any worse than he is.

I guess my point: Why single out this lady? Why not the person on the other side of the mic. Or discourse at other places that's far more egregious. Seems somewhere between unsound and dishonest to point the finger of blame and her and not him.

---

In this conversation between Sen Josh Hawley and whoever the lady is, the context is clear. He's not dumb. He knew what she meant. He could have as easily said: ""No, because I do not acknowledge people's gender as a choice but rather a biological consequence of birth.""

And if you are going to hold her to a standard that says she was being ""unsound, dishonest and dangerous to a free society"", it seems reasonable to hold him to the same one.

Again: In the world of ""unsound, dishonest, and dangerous to a free society"" discourse going on in the US right now, this seems pretty low on the scale. But if we want to examine this conversation, he's easily as at fault as she is on these same metrics.",2022-07-14 11:05:39,2022-07-14 11:27:01

1. The US putting the entire 18-20 year population (several million people) on government payroll would be exorbitantly expensive and a massive drain on resources.
2. It wouldn't be a good return on investment, because the government would spend two years training these people to be good at their positions; and right when they developed the requisite skills and knowledge, they'd leave and go to college.
3. Rebuilding houses and making community gardens is nice, but there's not really enough work for millions and millions of people to do that would justify the cost and resources of the program.
4. Forcing every single person into mandatory service to government for two straight years of their lives (and let's be honest, for low pay and no benefits) would be incredibly immoral, and almost certainly ripe for abuses of power.
5. ""Adulthood"" is already being pushed back farther and farther, especially because many well-paying careers also require advancement degrees (Masters, etc.). So many people *already*  aren't able to be self-sufficient adults until their late 20s. Adding another two years of mandatory service would push it back even further.
6. College already fulfills many of outcomes you mention (having new experiences, seeing the world, developing as a person, gaining valuable professional skills, etc.)
7. Most 18-20 years are perfectly capable and mature enough to go to college and enter workforce. Furthermore, many of them already have concrete career plans. Forcing them to wait *another* two years just wastes their time.
8. There are *already* great programs like PeaceCorp and AmeriCorp where 18-20 years old can (and gladly do) enter into these roles out of their own free will, no compulsion required.",2022-07-14 11:33:06,2022-07-14 11:33:06

It might seem simple, but it allows for movements like The Arab Spring, Black Lives Matter, and Occupy Wall Street.

ig9bojj,gremy0,"Like with most of these things, I don't think people have an issue with borrowing and being influenced by other cultures, it just needs to be done with sensitivity. As you say, you don't condone this being done to reinforce stereotypes, but you have the condition of it being done for the purpose of that; the reality is that you don't need to be purposely stereotyping something to end up stereotyping it, it can be completely by accident. 

For example, it's quite easy for western trained musicians to look at or hear indian rāgas and think ""oh, these are just like scales, or modes"", then adopt this understanding and tell people they are using a ragas- which has often been done. The issue is that rāgas are a much broader concept than that, they aren't just scale information, they include a load of other form, style and time direction that western musicians simply don't package together in the same way. Equating the two is a massive oversimplification that erases a lot of the musical theory, culture and history of indian music 

The effect here is that you, just through (probably well intentioned) ignorance, end up stereotyping. 

It's therefore not enough to be merely good intentioned, you should also be aware to the fact you don't know the culture you are borrowing from that well and may make mistakes in your understanding of it. And if you're going to do it, maybe take reasonable steps to make sure you aren't borrowing in a way that is detrimental to the thing you are borrowing from.",2022-07-15 06:00:15,2022-07-15 06:00:15

His audience [wasn't just white people](https://www.newsweek.com/elvis-presley-40-years-later-was-king-rock-n-roll-guilty-appropriating-black-651911):

&gt; This era of biracial musical creation and consumption has been largely erased from popular memory. It lies buried beneath simplistic parables of white expropriation and exploitation of black culture in which Elvis has become emblematic of centuries of uncompensated and unacknowledged white appropriation of black cultural ingenuity and labour.

&gt; There is enormous moral power to this perspective and, to be sure, plenty of evidence of just such exploitation and theft. Nonetheless, it still makes for unpersuasive history and fails to help us to understand the significance of Elvis and the whole biracial rock-and-roll phenomenon that intersected with the dawn of the modern civil rights movement.

&gt; Nat Williams, the dean of black announcers on WDIA, had immediately recognised this symbolic linkage. At the Goodwill Ball, Williams had pondered the enthusiasm of black audiences for Elvis, ""when they hardly let out a squeak over B.B. King, a Memphis cullud boy."" Williams speculated that this might ""reflect a basic integration in attitude and aspiration"" in the black community.

&gt; He was right. The piebald charts and radio playlists of the late 1950s and early 1960s, like black admiration for young Elvis, belonged to a particular moment of rising black activism and cautious optimism about the prospects for widespread, meaningful and enduring changes in the pattern of U.S. race relations.",2022-07-15 06:06:46,2022-07-15 06:06:46

ig9metl,smcarre,"The difference there is that Elvis was specifically selected by the music industry (specifically Sam Philips, who went on record to say this) to sell black music to white people since white people didn't want to hear black musicians but liked black music so they wanted to listen a white man sing black music.

That was an inherently racist attitude, not wanting to listen to a musician for the color of their skin, and that's the wrong part. A similar example but not wrong would be Eminem, another white musician that shined in a traditionally black genre but not because white people didn't want to listen to black men rapping but because he simply brought new things to the genre (and his would be Sam Philips was himself a black man, Dr Dre).

---

He was already preforming that music, but was not known for doing that and he didn't sell any records while just doing that. But you are missing that people don't consider Elvis to be wrong for **just singing** (nobody considers wrong for white people to rap on their showers for example) but to be wrong for recording black music (keep in mind we are not just talking about a genre, Elvis quite literally did covers of songs already written and recorded by black musicians and those were his first hits selling records of covers) to sell it to white people. 

How aware was Elvis about this is hard to say and most people that know Elvis would say he wasn't racist himself (many of his band were black people and he even collaborated with black musicians from time to time) but even if Elvis wasn't racist he could be just naive of the damage he was doing to black musicians by recording their music for white people. And even if someone is not aware of the damage they are doing doesn't mean that the action isn't wrong, that's what people criticize of Elvis.

Just to clarify, the damage is not to perform a music style, that's perfect. The damage is done when the music style ""belongs"" to a minority that likely is at an economic or systemic disadvantage and someone outside of that minority takes that style to profit out of their economic or systemic advantage (which is what Elvis did after starting selling records to white people since he was at a systemic advantage by virtue of just being white). That profit would/should go to the minority who ""owns"" that style which would help them reduce the gap in economic or systemic advantage, instead it's used to benefit someone outside of that minority.

---

&gt; but I don't think that the music in itself is offensive simply because it ""belongs"" to another culture than him.

And I agree, but like I say to you, the problem is not that Elvis just performed black music, its that Elvis performed, recorded and sold black music for white people, basically denying a big amount of profits that would have gone directly to the black community.

&gt; What was important was having your own rendition of it, and to my memory Elvis definitely sounds distinct to the originals, even if it is the same song.

It's worth wondering if Elvis' distinct style was what brought value to the cover (in the ears of record buyers) or if it was the fact that his skin was white. Impossible to prove by now but I would say that the latter was much more common than the former (which to clarify, is not an insult on Elvis' signing or style).

&gt; but I mean the audience that he was bringing black music to would never have heard of these artists of their own accord anyway

That's the problem, they did. Black music was already liked by white people, Sam Philips knew this, he was already selling them black music before Elvis, but he knew there was a big portion of the white demographic that refused to support black artists out of simple racism even if they liked the music which is why he searched and found Elvis and had him record black music for white people.

Also worth mentioning, the profit of the record wasn't the only problem. Live music was also a problem for black artists at the time, most music clubs at the time were extremely segregated (there were clubs for white people to go, and clubs for black people to go) and many white clubs refused to allow black artists to play live there but since white people wanted to listen to black music anyways, white clubs often had white bands that did live covers of black music, only that people went there for the music, not the band (which is proof that white people aready liked black music). Elvis was one of the first white musicians that started to give concerts in clubs where white people would go to their white clubs to listen to Elvis specifically. Had black artists been allowed to play in white clubs, it's likely artists like Big Mama Thornton would have attracted (and profited from) big white audiences. Even if most whites wouldn't want to hear a black woman sing, there were whites who did but couldn't hear her live because their club didn't allow black musicians and she would only play at their local black club.

igagxup,OtHanski,"Additional point, in urban areas bikes are actually much closer in speed to cars than pedestrians. A person who cycles regularly probably cycles somewhere between 20 and 30 kilometers per hour. A car in a city area is likely driving 40-60 kph, or about a factor of 2 difference

On the other hand, a pedestrian walking at a brisk pace might walk 5-6 kph, while someone on a leisurely stroll (or children) might only walk 3-4 kph. Compared to a cyclist, that's a factor of &gt;5 difference. So a pedestrian is much slower (and more disruptive) compared to a cyclist than a cyclist to a person driving a car.

Additionally, a bicycle uses a road in a manner much more similar to how cars are driven than how a pedestrian walks. Both cars and cyclists prefer open, predictable lanes and drive more or less in a line or a slight curve at any given time. Pedestrians on the other hand tend to be a lot less predictable in their routing, swaying side to side, occasionally perhaps stopping, crossing the sidewalk at any time. 

This means that a cyclist on a road behaves in a relatively predictable manner to a car driver, but if a bicyclist drives on a sidewalk, the pedestrians tend to be rather unpredictable in their pathing, causing potential collision risks. This risk is even greater when you consider that the pedestrian density on a busy sidewalk is quite a lot higher than the density of cars on a road, so for a cyclist on a sidewalk, there's a shit ton of extremely unpredictable collision risks walking around.

All in all, while people driving cars always seem to get road rage at the fact that there are people driving less than 20kph over the speed limit on the road, it's a much better solution than putting bikes on sidewalks.",2022-07-15 10:43:03,2022-07-15 10:43:03

igajhra,MostRecommendation84,"You've stumbled into a massive topic that there's a lot of papers already on, but the short of it is that a key component of culture you're missing is law/customs which are intertwined with social and political trust. Countries with high political and social trust tend to be more accommodating of immigrants, however it's also important to note there's a consistent negative correlation between social trust and diversity(hence Denmark/Germany having two of the most rapidly growing nationalist movements in Europe), or in other words, social trust is a finite resource that's depleted the more you take in immigrants, high political trust decreases the cost, but a cost remains. Countries with low political trust to begin with correlate with a negative perception of immigration and have a steeper cost in social trust when they take more immigrants on. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of real life-applications: social trust is linked to crime rates and corruption, political trust is linked to political stability. Political trust isn't directly correlated to social trust, however there's a lagging tendency for political trust to fall as social trust falls(likely due to the organization and growth of opposition parties like said above nationalists). 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR, you can't just stuff the ""nice"" countries with immigrants and expect it to work out because they'll eventually stop being nice places either due to political infighting, negative attitudes towards immigrants and/or the ruling party, or rising crime/corruption. This is a massive component of what reactionaries are trying to push back against in terms of ""culture"".

Which means that you may be using different meaning of culture compared to those who you are not agreeing with. Culture usually means both:  
\- arts and other manifestations of human intellectual achievement  
\- ideas, customs, and social behavior of a particular people or society

&gt;I never said accept all immigrants. I'm discussing refugees

But you have referenced Syrian refugee crisis, where refugees were fleeing to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey - not Italy or Greece. And you used this crisis to debate sentiments that arose during 2015 European migrant crisis.

&gt;I accept there are many solutions to supporting refugees, my point is that denying them entry out of a fear of cultural dilution is heinous, racist, and evil.

Sure, but the issue is what do you mean by refugee? For most people it's a person fleeing the war to neighboring country, not someone who is paying their life savings to be smuggled to country that is quite far.

---

&gt;I personally know Syrian refugees who fled to Greece, what are you talking about? 120,00 refugees fled to Greece.

Those 120k weren't refugees fleeing war but people who were granted asylum in Greece due to international treaty with Turkey (as they were country that had to accept refugees in accordance with international law, which put quite a strain on them).

igatd4k,poprostumort,"&gt;I'm defining culture as music, food, art, dress, religion, and language. 

Which means that you may be using different meaning of culture compared to those who you are not agreeing with. Culture usually means both:  
\- arts and other manifestations of human intellectual achievement  
\- ideas, customs, and social behavior of a particular people or society

I would assume that people who

&gt;deny entry to refugees and others because of fear of diluting their ""culture""

Mean that they don't want their social customs and behaviors to rapidly change due to influx of immigrants. Not 

&gt;maintaining the purity of a carbonara, baguette, or gyro.

Also you are creating a false dichotomy, where ""accepting all immigrants"" and ""letting them die"" are only two possible options, while it's rarely the issue as you can help them in their country and work with countries that border them to provide shelter and amenities.

---

&gt;I never said accept all immigrants. I'm discussing refugees

But you have referenced Syrian refugee crisis, where refugees were fleeing to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey - not Italy or Greece. And you used this crisis to debate sentiments that arose during 2015 European migrant crisis.

&gt;I accept there are many solutions to supporting refugees, my point is that denying them entry out of a fear of cultural dilution is heinous, racist, and evil.

Sure, but the issue is what do you mean by refugee? For most people it's a person fleeing the war to neighboring country, not someone who is paying their life savings to be smuggled to country that is quite far.

---

&gt;I personally know Syrian refugees who fled to Greece, what are you talking about? 120,00 refugees fled to Greece.

Those 120k weren't refugees fleeing war but people who were granted asylum in Greece due to international treaty with Turkey (as they were country that had to accept refugees in accordance with international law, which put quite a strain on them).

&gt;Sure there's a difference between method of transit, the people fleeing Syria did so because of the violence and war.

I know, but however cruel that will sound, that does not mean that they are entitled to use that as a free ticket to anywhere. This means that neighboring countries have to take them and prepare accommodations, and that those countries can ask other countries to help.

&gt;Your second to last paragraph does come across as cruel.

It's because reality is cruel and dismissing that will not change reality. Syria bordered Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey - countries that were accepting refugees already. After they were accepted, there could be further help, whether it would be financial (to supply refugee camps) or migrational (to grant asylum to refugees in other countries).

Simply accepting refugees in countries that don't share a border will mean that you are opening hunting season for assholes who prey on the same refugees you want to protect. Because some jackass will ara shitty boat, take a modest fee of ""everything you have"" to transport you in inhumane and unsafe conditions to a country that is ""so developed that they are literally giving money"".

If you accept those transports, then it's a viable business - meaning that they will ferry more, not caring if someone who already paid them for ""ticket"" will die during transport. All that indefinitely.

If you don't accept - then they may scam people in first weeks of war, but longer it would be there will be more stories of refugees who were sent back and share how they were preyed upon. Which meant less transports and less human suffering.

Example:

If Bojack Horsemen existed in real life, would it be okay to kill him? After all he’s not a human life. The answer is no as Bojack has consciousness

---

“Are not sufficient to resolve”

Than how would you suggest resolving this debate.

“There’s nothing in the universe that says conciseness is important to personhood”

That doesn’t matter. What matters is being consistent, logical and rational.

We all have to make faith based claims. What matters is being consistent 

“They should be persons aswell”

You’re being hypocritical. You are arbitrarily defining the beginning of their book to be at conception when you could just as easily of decided that the start was being a sperm. Therefore sperm cells could also be granted a right to life.

“I would consider Bojack to be a person but only because I Can’t find a morally relevant difference”

Define morally relevant?

---

a) the notion of human value is not really rational. Obviously human beings are going to say human beings have value, because we’re human. But what about animal life? All throughout the west we see more people and politicians push for animals to be granted a right to life. Why? Because they are sentient. For me, if I was non sentient, I wouldn’t mind not having a right to life.

b) you have to understand, personhood is just your rights. Getting rid of it doesn’t help the debate as we’re still debating the right to life which is personhood.

c) define “distinguishable from another human organism”?

---

a) animal rights matters because if only human beings have a right to life than we would also logically have to get rid of all animal rights laws. The rise in animal rights activism shows that the right to life is intuitively connected to sentience within most people

b) I think this is more semantics as rights are fundamentally connected to ethics and morality for me so any discussion of ethics and morality is also connected to rights in my mind and therefore personhood is relevant. Even than this portion of this debate really isn’t that relevant, C is.

C) what would those properties be?

---

a) I mean in all honesty you’re doing the exact same thing horrible people throughout history have done. You’re being less expensive with the definition of personhood. I’m being more expansive by including animal rights.

C) what would be properties that show it’s different from, for example, a skin cell?

---

a) wait what? Isn’t Peter Singer on my side. Doesn’t he also support a sentience based framework.

C) I’m pretty sure it’s the same DNA but what about the DNA of the unborn makes it different?

---

Ya know I re read some of this thread and I think I noticed where I went wrong. You said that human DNA or genes is what matters to you. This however disregards what you said earlier about Bojack Horsemen as Bojack wouldn’t have Human Genes. Btw have you ever read super man? Super man is partly a commentary on personhood. Super man doesn’t have human genes or DNA, he’s an alien. Under your model, someone like super man wouldn’t have a right to life.

Thus after some review I do think there’s a contradiction within your logic in regards to what you’ve stated now and earlier, especially in regards to Bojack Horsemem.

Furthermore, I think my primary issue with your argument for me is the use of the genetic criterion. Now you’ve chosen to use Genes instead of DNA but every single cell in a person’s body has those unique Genes so logically shouldn’t it follow that those skin cells also have a right to life?

---

“I then admitted that I would value the life of Bojack Horsemen in the absence of any such morally relevant distinct”

Wouldn’t the morally relevant distinction be that he’s not human and lacks human genes in this case?

“I wanted to ground our conversation in reality”

The character super man exists partly to make this argument. That saying something has moral value because it’s human really doesn’t make sense. Or at-least is completely unintuitive.

Lex Luthor is supposed to have the opposite effect.

---

Well in all honesty we’re clearly talking in circles but I really don’t understand the argument you’re making here. In order to be consistent you need to craft principles that apply to different situations consistently. Basing the right to life on having human genes is not consistent as you now have to adjust your thinking when it comes to situations involving Bojack Horsmen and Superman. 

My worldview is consistent, I use sentience to determine personhood and I am consistent in multiple situations such as in regards to super man.

One thing I brought up earlier and that I haven’t got an answer from you is the overall issue with the genetic criterion. You say the right to life should be given to those with unique genes but this would mean every cell in a person’s body has the right to life which is clearly irrational.

“Why should we diminish the life of the unborn because they are not sentient. There is nothing in the universe that says sentience matters”

Well a decision on the right to life has to be made and using sentience is the most consistent and thus rational way of thinking.

---

“Looking at its DNA”

There’s DNA in every single cell in your body. This is why the genetic criterion doesn’t work. The right to life can’t be based solely on DNA otherwise tongue cells would gain the right to life.

“Sentience is arbitrary”

What your arguing is also arbitrary, everything is arbitrary in the sense that we all have to make faith based claims but that doesn’t change the fact that some faith based claims are better than others and we measure which are better using consistency.

“Using sentience as a qualifier would disqualify all of us when we’re sleeping”

No and the defence that Utilitarians use for this can be traced back to the Epicureans. When you sleep, you have the desire to wake up the next morning. Your Desires are stored pleasures. Stored pleasures are completely consistent with Utilitarian lines of thinking, for example a person who exercises is undergoing pain but they do so for their desire to be healthy which is a stored future pleasure. The Capacity to suffer still carries on in one’s sleep and therefore a sleeping person can’t be killed.

---

“Again, I am not using the possession of DNA as the critieria for a right to life. All I am saying is that rights only apply to organisms, not inanimate objects, and one way to identify if something is an organism is that it has DNA. That's it. To summarize even further, organisms have moral value. Humans are an organism. Therefore, humans have moral value.”

You’re loosing me here. Plants and bacteria are also organisms yet obviously you wouldn’t consider plants and bacteria to have a right to life. You’ll say human organisms are different, and then I’ll say they are observably different because of sentience.

“You assert some criteria are better than others, but then you also admit that the criteria you are using is arbitrary. If this is the case, in what meaningful sense is sentience a better criteria?”

Everything is arbitrary because we all have to make faith based claims which are self evident and therefore arbitrary. However that doesn’t change the fact that certain faith based claims are more rational and consistent than others and therefore better.

“The concept of ""stored pleasures"" presupposes that we judge the moral value of a human being not by a particular state of awareness (sleeping), but based on the continuity of their existence as a being with desires. But this broadens the concept of sentience from the actual ability to suffer to the capacity/potentiality to suffer.  This same line of reasoning could be used for the unborn by arguing that the unborn have a capacity to suffer in so far as they are a kind of organism (human) that can suffer, despite not being able to actualize it in their current stage of development.”

No it couldn’t be used by the unborn because they have no ability to interact with pain and pleasure until sentience. A sleeping person already had formulated desires while the unborn don’t.

There’s no potentiality because the person already in that moment has pains and pleasures figured out.

Think about it this way. If society killed people in their sleep than people wouldn’t be able to sleep which would cause pain

---

“Ah, I suppose a consequence would be that plants and bacteria have moral value. Though it is possible that they have moral value, I am willing to concede that this is a bit much. As a result, I will simply revise my position and argue that we cannot know what conditions need to be met in order for something to have moral value. “

I believe the sub rules mandate that I get a delta. If you could give one I would highly appreciate it.

“As a result, we should just aim to be as inclusive as possible with the kinds of organisms that we deem to have moral value to increase the chances of not accidentally disqualifying them from having a right to life. “

You should be inclusive up until the point inclusivity breaks down. If you’re too expansive and irrational with the right to life than it becomes arbitrary and any attempt at inclusivity would break down after that expansion.

“Bacteria and plants are radically different from human beings. In so far as we are more confidence that human beings have moral value than bacteria or plants, “ 

This is an appeal to human moral intuition which is what I’ve been doing this entire time.

“I have much more confidence that unborn humans have moral value as well. As such, there is larger risk of disqualifying the unborn from having moral value by using cognitive characteristics like sentience as the standard for moral value.”

But we know from human moral intuition that sentience is clearly important.

“You say the unborn have no ability to interact with pain or pleasure, but neither does a sleeping person despite having previously formulate desires. The fact that they previously formed desires is seemingly unrelated to the sentience requirement, and it is unclear how having formulated a desire should instill moral value. To avoid these problems, I would say that both a sleeping person and the unborn have moral value because they share the same potentialities inherent to their form to do so.”

I disagree, the utilitarian moral ethic, in particular the negative utilitarian moral ethic states is about reducing suffering for those with the capacity to suffer. Killing people in their sleep would only create chaos and create more suffering for those with the capacity to suffer as they can now not sleep to alleviate suffering. Therefore you’re increasing suffering.

“To use the Aristotelan concept of Form, each of us is a combination of matter and form. The matter in which we are composed explains what is particular about each human, while the form explains what is universal/what we have in common as humans (essence). The potentialities in the human form define and limit the ways we can develop and change (e.g. humans lack the potentiality to fly because we lack wings). As a result, one can be considered fully human by virtue of possessing those potentialities that make up the human form, regardless of the extent to which one exercise them. Feeling pain and suffering is a potentiality of embedded in the form of a human. As a result, even if the unborn cannot actualize a feeling of pain or suffering, they still possess the potentiality to do so. Similarly, a person who is sleeping may not be able feel pain or suffer, but they still possess the potential to do so by virtue of their form which possesses that potentiality. In so far as a sleeping person and the unborn are fully human because they share the same human form, they also share the same capacity/potentialities to feel pain and suffer, even if they cannot actualize those potentialities. And in so far as human have moral value, then by virtue of sharing the same form, then all humans are morally valuable, including the unborn.”

Potentiality arguments have never worked for me because sperm also the potential to suffer. It cannot be the potential to suffer that matters but rather whether or not it can currently suffer.",2022-07-14 06:17:45,2022-07-15 14:37:04
igbsvtt,elmonoenano,"I basically agree with you. But I think there's a couple of ways where it can be inappropriate. One is to do a very superficial version of the music in a way that reinforces stereotypes. Minstrel music is the obvious example that jumps to mind. People in black face doing exaggeratedly bad grammar or dialect, ""Massa Massa"" type stuff, that encourages and enforces racism. But I don't think that's the kind of stuff you're talking about.

The other one, and the one that's trickier, is the Elvis example people are citing. Elvis is a little more complicated so I'm not going to address him directly. But there's a spectrum of appropriation. There's lots of white artists that mimic African American music. And probably at the more clearly harmless end are bands like UB40 for the reasons you mentioned. They're clearly fans of reggae and are influenced by it, even though it's not very good. But the odds that someone is shut out from reggae music b/c of UB40 (Peter Tosh or Pere Ubu were probably never denied a show or a record contract b/c of UB40) is probably 0 or pretty close to that.

At the other end of the spectrum is the musician I love to hate, Pat Boone. Pat Boone used his whiteness to perform Black music (specifically profiting off of Little Richard) in venues that Black artists were shut out of and making more money off their music than they were able to. Little Richard couldn't play the venues Pat Boone could. He couldn't get on the radio stations Pat Boone could. He couldn't get on the TV shows or get the record deals, etc. And it was b/c of his race. So Pat Boone made an entire career out of Little Richards music and the fact that Little Richard was blocked by racism and segregation from most venues in society. I think pretty much everyone would agree that that was wrong.

Most musical appropriation isn't Pat Boone, especially now that most of that segregation is illegal. 

People argue where Elvis falls on that spectrum. I tend to think he falls closer to the Pat Boone side than the UB40 side, but he's not necessarily as exploitive. Elvis played what was considered ""race"" music back then. But he wasn't covering Black artists. Most of his songs were written by white label mates at Sun or by the song writing team of Lieber and Stoller. They were definitely appropriating Black style music, and there's questions about how much they borrowed or lifted and how much they wrote, but Elvis wasn't involved in that. He was just the performer. Elvis did play segregated venues, but he wasn't using his whiteness as directly as Boone was. So, I kind of put Elvis more in a category of a bridge that introduces an audience from one culture to the great art of another culture. I think the Beastie Boys did that for most Americans as far as hip hop went. Gershwin did it for a lot of Americans in terms of Jazz. And I think these people actually open some doors. You can contest how much and how fair that is, but I don't think it's evil like I think Pat Boone is evil.

So, I agree with you but I think it's worth thinking about these two areas where it does seem to be wrong. I also think that on the Elvis/Pat Boone side of the the spectrum it's not always clear where the lines are and what's exploitive versus what's a cultural bridge that generally improves things for everybody and that different people will come to different conclusions.",2022-07-15 16:16:27,2022-07-15 16:16:27

Someone with a disability that means, say, they can't write fast, is going to be disproportionately affected by these time limits. At that point, you're no longer testing their understanding of the material, you're testing their abilitiy to take tests.

Which mostly isn't what you want. If you're going to get a job as, say, a research assistant in a lab, they want to know how well you understand the science. You're probably not going to be writing things under much time pressure, and even if you do need to do that, they'll have accommodations that aren't available in exams, like speech to text software or something similar.

So if a disabled person doesn't get that extra time, it's going to look like they understand the material worse than their fellow abled students, but they don't. The exam has given a false impression.

If they are given extra time, then the test will reflect their actual knowledge, not their disability. And they're probably going to disclose their disability to the employer anyway, so there's no reason the test needs to account for this information.

&gt;Your premise is flawed. You were not 'assigned', you were observed.

This is a silly nitpick and is also wrong at it's core. Observations can often be wrong or incomplete. If we only viewed newborns from the belly-button up, we wouldn't be able to discern a difference. Likewise, making an assignment of a child based on physical observation is fundamentally incomplete. If an assignment is made that assignment can and should be adjusted once the child grows up and more information is gathered.

&gt; That's not what that means at all. An elephant doesn't stop being an elephant because you chopped off it's trunk, it's just a damaged elephant. That also doesn't mean there is something outside biology defining 'maleness', i'm not sure how you came to this conclusion.

What I'm saying is that observation is not the entire story and is not completely reliable. It is a piece of information, but simple observation doesn't tell us everything we need to know. 

Consider fools gold. At first observation it may seem like gold. They share a lot of the same properties, but with a little more information we learn they are completely different. Observation is important data, but we now understand that genetic development is a spectrum and that sexual organs don't determine gender. So observation alone isn't sufficient, hence my example.

---

We can, but the guy I was responding to was conflating sex and gender. I've already pointed out that nobody is denying what parts people are born with. However, being a man or a woman isn't determined by the genitalia you're born with, and there are more complicated factors beyond just having a penis or a vagina.

---

[This flowchart](https://static.miraheze.org/lgbtawiki/4/4a/Sex-spectrum.png) might help you a bit. When I say things are more complicated and that people exist on a spectrum this is what I'm talking about. The biological factors that make up a person's sex as well as their ultimate gender identity are much more complicated than the other commenter was trying to make it seem. 

&gt; But you said gender isn't derived from biology or characteristics, and that you can be a man if you say you're one. So why isn't dragon a gender if gender has no definition or characteristics? If you say you're a dragon and are acknowledged as a dragon, then you're saying someone can be a dragon.

If someone says this to you, it's a bad faith argument. Consider what people who identify as nonbinary say, generally their sexual identification is about how they approach sexual identity and how they view themselves e.g. ""I am asexual, I am genderqueer, I am trans"" these all act to explain how they consider themselves. To consider the famous ""one joke"", how does an apache attack helicopter express sexuality? It clearly doesn't, it's a bad faith tactic to make fun of someone trying to define and represent how they view themselves. 

Beyond that, the current research as shown in the flow chart I linked lends itself to the fact that sex isn't binary.

igg7c9p,ArcadesRed,"Seeing your other responses. Why do you keep saying the government has enough resources to do things like build everyone a house. They would have to fund a massive housing project through higher taxes. You are saying that you believe that the citizen should pay for houses for every homeless person. The government cannot freely provide, that's not a thing. 

Experiments in the USA on both native american reservations and inner-city housing projects has shown a absolute failure of providing free housing to people. It is a failure in great part because of lack of personal ownership of the home. If you destroy it they will simple provide you another. 

Churches and community groups used to provide most assistance. Now there are many states where the government is the only ones allowed to provide assistance with use of tax funds instead of donations. 

Still talking about the USA. Pre HMO's healthcare was affordable to the average family without insurance. The introduction of HMO's, allowed by the government, is what has driven prices so high through a mix of regional non compete and price negotiations between hospitals and HMO's over price. Even the precursor to HMO's was job provided healthcare. That came about because during WW2 pay was capped by the government and businesses were forced to find ways to attract better workers. So they provided free healthcare.

Working conditions were improved by unions demanding it, government regulation came after it was mostly figured out. The government was long against unionization so much that the Army was deployed to quell rebellions at coal mines and factory towns.

I could go on and on, but what I am trying to convey is that a great majority of the time government intervention has negatively impacted a situation. They forcefully introduce themselves to a system, destroy it through mismanagement, poor bureaucracy and regulation and then point to the system and loudly tell everyone how they need more money and control of the system to fix it. 

The Laissez faire libertarian knows these things. The argument is always that "" that was the past, it's better this time"".

The artistic reason is that real CPR would destroy a person's ribcage, and thus could not be done a human actor in real life. The alternative would be to use a dummy of sorts, but that would look terrible. Or, you could us CGI and perhaps run up your budget. If you wish to include a CPR scene, faking it is the only safe way to do without comprising the look or budget. It's not that producers don't care, is that they have to make a product that looks good, and real CPR does not look good.

It's the same reason movies and TV do a lot of things that do not match reality. Reality often does not look good on camera or cannot properly be filmed.

igiamrb,EatMyBalcony,"It's entertainment, and everything else is wrong too. 

There are tons of medical examples, but the whole ""we've got to get the bullet out"" is one example that makes for a great movie scene where the protagonist shows how tough yet vulnerable they lie on the pool table and have their side kick pull a bullet out of their side or whatever. This is the same with knives and arrows, where ""getting it out"" is considered medically necessary, when that very thing stuck inside of you could be what is preventing you from bleeding out. Just like CPR I don't think that many people are put in these situations and relying on their pop culture knowledge to *help* someone, but this is just as much ""spreading harmful misinformation and misconceptions"".

Ever watched someone drive a car in a movie? Even if you completely ignore all of the stunts and things and look at normal driving on screen, you rarely see seatbelts, the headrests are often removed from the front seats for sightlines, people rarely watch the road/obey laws and safety rules, etc. It's become such a trope that ""Quick, grab the wheel because we're drifting into oncoming traffic"" or off a cliff or some other last minute jerk the car back to where it should be because we weren't paying attention happens all the time. In my jurisdiction, there are laws preventing teenagers from driving around with other teenagers, because they are expecting them to be distracted and cause accidents. 

There are a ton of other examples that are similar to your idea of ""if this isn't properly represented, some people in the audience could think this is reality"" from medical/health scenes and shows, where they are set in hospitals and the doctoring is all doctored. Have you seen the lifeguarding that happens in Baywatch?

Want some less life and death examples? Ever seen any show/movie where the leads are students, have service jobs like waiting tables or being a barista, or are never seen to be employed at all, yet they live an upper-middle class life in a big city in a giant apartment? Turns out you can't afford any of that stuff without 4 of those jobs, good luck fitting in some plot around 80 hours a week of minimum wage. 

Ever seen someone play an instrument in a movie, like a guitar without any strings on it? 

Do you think guns with ""silencers"" on them actually sound like that?

There are tons of things that are not portrayed accurately in entertainment. Some productions will hire experts and consultants to ask if they are doing something remotely close to plausible, but for the most part they are trying to entertain. 

If you want entertainment to be just a series of instructional videos on how to really do life the right way because they have a legal obligation to portray everything accurately because people might assume that they saw it in a movie so that must be the right way, where does the entertainment come from?

Over half of cardiac arrest victims out of hospital do not recover from CPR. Is that how the movies portray it? Do we need to see proper CPR performed, with ribs cracking and everything done right, and the person dies anyway?

Sure, I also get annoyed when I notice that the realism in my entertainment is lacking.

igiaq56,MeanderingDuck,"Actually, showing it correctly *is* fairly difficult. CPR is a rather violent procedure, and not one that should be performed on anyone who doesn’t actually need it. So they can’t just do it properly and film it, they would need to come up with some form of movie trickery to accomplish that. 

And suppose they did, what would it actually accomplish? You don’t learn proper CPR technique from watching it done in movies, even if they do it correctly. Getting the positioning, movement and timing right, though not exactly difficult, is something you need to be actually taught explicitly for you to know how to do it in an emergency. And even with that, understanding quite how much force you actually have to apply for it to be effective is something you pretty much just have to have practiced. 

Finally, people would not just need to know how to do it properly, but would also have to know *when* it should be applied in the first place and how to reliably determine that. As noted, it’s not something that should be used on people who don’t need it; while getting some ribs cracked is a small cost for people who indeed do, if someone eg. just fainted you definitely shouldn’t want some overzealous movie buff laying their hands on them anyway.",2022-07-17 04:48:24,2022-07-17 04:48:24

Then for another generation - 50 years again - you can start letting men play a few sports.  Mind you - make sure they get the worst facilities.  Play games when it suits the girls/women so as not to interfere with the important girls/women’s games and practices.  Also make sure that you make fun of guys who participate in sports.  They need to know that boys don’t play sports.  

Then you can slowly integrate boys into playing sports.  Maybe let them play in college or even professionally.  Again don’t overdo it.  But, hey - maybe give the guys a break.

&gt;My source said ""5 and a half to 6 weeks after gestation"".  Didn't know the word gestation, looked up what ""weeks after gestation"" means and it says it's the time after the last period and it's the same as the weeks of pregnancy. Is that not right?

While primitive heart functions are detecteble at around 6 weeks, the embryo does not d a fetus until around 10 weeks.

HOWEVER I dug a little deeper and wasn't able to find the actual study/survey/anything remotely scientific where that number comes from.

igjfhlm,A-passing-thot,"&gt;Phelps was a dominant athlete. No doubt. But typically the people he was sharing a podium with, in Silver + Bronze positions were less than a second behind him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Putting him into a race with children, amateurs, elderly swimmers, Paralympians or women would have been unfair.

I really like this argument.  Essentially you're asking, ""from a statistical perspective was he outside the normal range for male athletes"" or ""was his performance such that other athletes could not be competitive against him/have a ""fair"" (statistically) chance of winning"".  And your answer is ""no, he was still within the normal male bell curve, within the range of other men even though his advantage was enough to consistently win, it wasn't an *unfair* advantage, it was a marginal one.""

&gt;They don't have an advantage in the actual league/game/contest that they're playing in. At least, not an unfair one.

Exactly, sports and a given league select for the traits necessary to compete in that league/sport.  E.g. if my fianceé and I went to play basketball with the other women we hang out with regularly, we'd have an unfair advantage because we're both in the top 5% for height &amp; several of our friends are in the bottom 5% (one's 4'10"") but when the university's volleyball team walked into the Starbucks I was working in recently, I was shorter than every player except 1.  In other words, height ends up not being an unfair advantage because a given league/sport will select for that height among all players who are otherwise equal in their training, natural ability, etc.

I think this framework you set up is extremely well suited to evaluating the athletic fairness of trans women.  Interestingly, all the trans athletes we hear about on the news still perform entirely within the normal bell curve of athletic performance for cis women &amp; all regularly lose to cis women.  Trans women don't hold any state, national, or world records in any event of any sport.

&gt;Because some sports like Rugby or Football (soccer) rely on a range of body shapes and sizes to fulfill different roles on the team. Others like say gymnastics or weightlifting or marathon are particularly suited to certain body types.

This is good too.  It really illustrates that trans women's bodies might have a (fair) advantage in some sports, particularly those selecting for size that don't have weight classes like football or rugby, and a disadvantage in others selecting for small and light athletes like cycling or gymnastics and those that segregate by weight class would likely have no advantage or disadvantage.

---

&gt;Regardless, transwomen who have undergone male puberty are banned from Rugby due to safety concerns. That is, they tend to have more explosive power, heavier mass, stronger bones etc, which endangers the ciswomen they may be tackling or scrumming with.

While I do think trans women (and any cis women of comparable size) have an advantage if they would not ban an *identical* cis woman, it seems unfair to ban them.

That being said, white trans women generally have a lower BMD than black cis women who's BMD is generally equal to white cis men.  So, bone density isn't an issue here.  Plus, it would only be protective &amp; is speculated to be a disadvantage due to the ""small engine, big car"" problem.

Explosive power has also not been shown in *any* study &amp; in non-team sports, trans women have been entirely in the normal range, not ""dominating"".  Also backed up by the BJSM Air Force study.

&gt;which endangers the ciswomen they may be tackling or scrumming with.

Seems like the safe &amp; fairest thing to do would just be to set an upper limit to size.

&gt;Male punching and kicking power is vastly more powerful than Females'.

Certainly, but post-transition this is not true of trans women.

&gt;For weight lifting, I believe body composition would have a significant impact, as women tend to have higher percentage of body fat, and in different bodily areas. Perhaps this issue is containable after 4-5 years on hormones, I'm not sure.

Most research points to 2 or fewer years for this - provided someone isn't at the extreme for body fat percentage before transition.  Much shorter for athletes.

&gt;Females also have a different centre of gravity than males. You may have seen videos on YouTube of men who cannot stand up from certain positions, while for women it's easy.

Anecdotally, this likewise applies to trans women. 

&gt;Although I'm not sure precisely what advantage could be attained, it is absolutely a factor which cannot change after transition.

If you can find a study showing this, I will award a delta.

---

Part 1:

I appreciate the link.  And while - to my knowledge - there aren't studies showing the inverse, the reasons the center of gravity are different are primarily due to fat distribution and men's upper bodies being disproportionately more muscled/stronger and transition changes both of those.

My views on the subject are heavily influenced by the fact that my own center of gravity shifted during transition - as did that of my many trans friends, both transmasc &amp; transfemme friends.  You mentioned those YouTube videos showing the differences by having people stand up from various positions, like the chair test &amp; we've done those because it was interesting to measure the ways our bodies were changing.  Transition does a lot of weird things that change our experience of the world, that's one of them.

&gt;World Rugby's stance is outlined here in more scientific and specific ways than my rather vague and generalised previous post. I'd be curious for your views on this, as it seems to be quite thorough, scientific and reasonable an approach.

Somewhat.  Their decision was heavily critiqued at the time.  The British Isles, particularly the UK, have an outsize influence on World Rugby &amp; are known for having a particularly anti-trans attitude.  Abigail Thorne - of PhilosophyTube - coined the term ""TERF Island"" because of it.  You can track the ideological shift over time across a variety of UK publications - though I'm most familiar with the *Economist*'s - and you can see it in their laws &amp; policies with respect to the Gender Recognition Act &amp; its controversy, the (temporary) blocking of access to gender affirming care for youth, particularly as a result of the work of Keira Bell, and the rise of most of the prominent TERF voices such as Maya Forstater, JK Rowling, and Graham Lineham.

As to an actual analysis, if you read through it, its analysis nearly wholly addresses the differences between men and women as justification for banning trans women, i.e. equating trans women and men which is both unscientific and transphobic.

The section on testosterone is interesting because they note that among both elite men and elite women, testosterone is not a strong predictor of performance, which is true, but *is* a predictor between categories.  *Then the citations stop* and they use that to argue that since within either group, testosterone isn't a reliable predictor then the reason it provides an advantage is *solely* because of the effects during puberty and that it's only a marker of having been through male puberty.

And that's easily belied by the fact that trans men perform comparably to cis men and trans women perform *entirely* within the cis female range - as noted in the link, there's no overlap &amp; a wide performance gap between elite male and female athletes.  Trans women do not bridge that gap.

As a side note, that's many people's impression, that trans women bridge the first half of that gap and trans men the second.  That is just false.

&gt;Effects of suppression of testosterone 

This is where they begin to address trans women.  Notably there have only been three studies (that I'm aware of) that have looked at the athletic performance by trans women, two by Joanna Harper &amp; one of Air Force members published in Dec. 2020 in the BJSM.  Both of Harper's used age-graded scores which compares the participant to their gender &amp; age matched cis cohort and found that trans women maintain the same score across transition.  The BJSM study found that trans women's performance in strength-based exercises decreased to be statistically the same as that of cis women's &amp; only an advantage in running.  However, their running scores decreased by the same margin as the ""standard"" gap between men and women and if you compare their control group to the general public, you'll notice that their gender gap does *not* match the standard.  If you use the generally accepted standard for controls in the subject, the advantage disappears.

&gt;Hilton &amp; Lundberg \[10\]: 

Their first citation in this section.  Interestingly, they left out that Dr. Emma Hilton is an anti-trans activist whose twitter is dedicated to supporting anti-trans policies and that the journal she published in had to issue a correction for her failure to disclose her financial conflicts of interest for accepting money from anti-trans organizations for paid speaking engagements.  On *top* of that heavy bias, I'd note she has *no* expertise in sports science, endocrinology, or physiology.  Her qualifications are *only* with respect to congenital bladder and eye abnormalities and *arguably* with respect to certain narrow genetic areas.

This citation is also notably not a study, but rather a *perspectives* paper (read opinion) framed as a review of the literature.  While she *did* review the literature, critics pointed out that she did not use a systematic framework for doing so as that would have prevented her from cherry picking the studies that match her conclusion, disregarding the analyses and conclusions of the original authors, and would have required her to address evidence to the contrary.

&gt;For instance, bone mass is typically maintained  in transgender  women over the  course of at least 24 months of testosterone suppression,  with some evidence even indicating small but significant increases in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine \[32-34\]

There is *no* scientific evidence that supports this being an advantage in sports.  In fact, most sports scientists argue that it's more likely to be a *disadvantage* due to the ""small engine, big car"" problem.  It's also notable that BMD varies more by ethnicity than by sex such that Black cis women have comparable BMD to white cis men &amp; that trans women typically already have lower BMD than cis men.

They then address pelvis width which *also* has no scientific evidence showing it provides an advantage either way &amp;, *again,* sports scientists think the relationship might go the other way since evidence points to women having a potential advantage in ultra long distance running (due to an energy/efficiency advantage).

Gonna have to do a part 2 I think.

Part 2: u/mankindmatt5

&gt;With respects to strength, 1 year of testosterone suppression and  oestrogen supplementation has been found to reduce thigh muscle area by 9% compared to baseline measurement \[35\]. After 3 years, a further reduction of 3% from baseline measurement occurred \[36\]. The total loss of 12% over three years of treatment meant that transgender women retained significantly higher thigh muscle size (p&lt;0.05) than the baseline measurement of thigh muscle area in transgender men (who are born female  and experience female puberty), leading to a conclusion that testosterone suppression in transgender women does not reverse muscle size to female levels \[36\].

The studies they cite here did not examine athletes and did not measure strength relative to size.  Per my above comments, trans men outperform trans women, which this paragraph suggests the opposite of.

&gt;This finding has been replicated and confirmed by numerous studies examining the  effects of testosterone suppression on lean body mass or muscle size in transgender women \[37- 44\]. Collectively, these studies find that 1 year of testosterone suppression to female­ typical reference levels results in a comparatively modest loss of lean body mass (LBM) or muscle size, with consistent changes between 3% and 5% reduction in LBM after 1 year of treatment (as summarized from source research studies by Hilton &amp; Lundberg \[10\]).

Again, they pulled nearly all of their research from the Hilton paper which they incorrectly refer to as a study.

&gt;For instance, hand-grip strength was reduced by 7% and 9% after 1 and 2 years, respectively, of cross­ hormone treatment in transgender  women \[39\], and by 4% in 249 transwomen after 1 year of gender-affirming treatment, with no variation between different testosterone levels, age or BMI tertiles \[45\]. Transgender women retained a 17% grip-strength advantage over transgender men at baseline measurement, with a similarly large, retained advantage when compared to normative data from a reference or comparison group of biological females.

Again, these studies were not performed in athlete, did not control for body size (i.e. larger people are stronger), and did not compare to cisgender controls of similar size, they used aggregated data as the control.  They also worded both this paragraph and the following (and also the preceding) to suggest that trans women have an advantage over trans men though they do not explicitly say so here (because that would be incorrect).

&gt;Conclusion

Well, *my* conclusion is this looks like a college student's paper when they're bringing their own biases to a subject and trying to prove a point rather than just presenting the research.  It looks like they had an agenda &amp; it should be suspicious that they didn't try to present it more neutrally.

&gt;While there is overlap in variables such as mass, strength, speed and the resultant kinetic and kinematic forces we have modelled to explore the risk factors, the situation where a typical player with male characteristics tackles a typical player with female characteristics increases the magnitude of known risk factors for head injuries by between 20% and 30%.

Again, trans women are not men.  This is fallacious.  You could make the argument based on height and weight, but then you could easily point out that they should be banning cis women above that threshold too but they don't which raises the question of why.  If they wanted to include trans women because they consider them to be women, then they could but they exclude even the stereotypical tiny waifish trans women.  

&gt;This is supported by evidence from various study models in which biological males reduce testosterone to within the female range, and are able to maintain or even increase these physiological variables through training \[46-48\].

\[46\] concluded that ""endogenous testosterone is of paramount importance to the adaptation to strength training."" And noted that the men who suppressed their testosterone were unable to gain strength during the *twelve week* suppression while their body fat percentage increased.  And this was only *twelve weeks*, not the *104* that other sports require for trans women.

\[47\] was a meta-analysis that looked at *men with cancer* and found that ""the mean difference for muscle strength was significant both in chest (3.15 kg, 95% CI: 2.46, 3.83; P &lt; 0.001) and in leg press (27.46 kg, 95% CI: 15.05, 39.87; p &lt; 0.001)"" and concluded that ""low- to moderate-intensity resistance and aerobic training \[...\] may not be sufficient to affect muscle mass in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT.""

\[48\] was included in \[47\] so they're really doubling up on this one because they want to try to make the point they haven't with the previous two contradicting their statement.  Again, this study was in elderly men with prostate cancer.  In the introduction to the paper they state:

&gt;the suppression of endogenous testosterone reduces muscle mass and strength (3–5) and increases fat mass (4,6) and generalized fatigue (6). Collectively, this can lead to a deterioration in physical function (3,7–10) and quality of life (QoL \[5,11\]). The muscle atrophy, functional declines, and weakness associated with ADT mimic effects seen with declines in testosterone with aging (12) but occur at faster rates and may accelerate the onset of sarcopenia and its related health consequences

However, this study *did* find that strength training can lead to improvements in muscle even without testosterone.  That shouldn't be a surprising finding given that women can *also* increase muscle without testosterone.  They're using this paper in a way it wasn't intended &amp; it did not examine what these men's muscle was relative to other men or to women.  And *again*, this was a short study looking at strength training *not* at testosterone suppression.

Following this section, they return to comparisons of men and women so there's no point in analyzing the rest.

Given *all* of that, do you still feel that was scientifically grounded and unbiased?  They went fishing &amp; basically pulled up a boot &amp; said it was a fish.",2022-07-16 13:11:43,2022-07-17 10:26:11

&gt;I was unaware of how much meat you could get for each rabbit.

&gt;However, bag limits vary state to state

Google is your friend. 
And you need to match targeted species to states. Shooting a moose is very different than shooting a deer in Florida with respect to meat delivered. Even with the same species, the state variation can be significant. The average weight of a deer in Florida is only 115lbs compared to Wisconsin where the average is over 150lbs. 

The fact is, there are ways this can be considered economical and ways it surely is not. But the simple fact is, a family *can* use appropriate species of wild game to economically supplement their food supply.

What about no? No state can unilaterally secede and the other states aren't going to allow California to leave. 

&gt; CA has the 7th largest economy in the WORLD

That's kinda predicated on it being a part of the United States. 

&gt;and the majority of the population deeply rejects the Trumpism that has swept up middle America and the South.

How does that qualify California to be a sovereign nation? 

&gt;So why are we still here?

We can't leave. It would be bad if we left. There's no workable plan of how we could leave. Pick one of those. 

&gt;Can you imagine how much this state would thrive if we focused all of our economic resources solely on CA?

No. We'd have much fewer economic resources. 

&gt;The rest of the country can continue to go to hell but CA doesn’t have to go down with it.

Kinda does. 

&gt;We’ve already distinguished ourselves from the rest of the country on everything from abortion to climate change.

Have we? How? 

&gt;Most of the state’s problems are caused by outside forces.

That's not really true. Outside forces don't elect our politicians. Outside forces don't waste our money on rail projects that don't pan out. Outside forces don't choose to do nothing about the homeless crisis. 

&gt;Oh, the homeless crisis is out of control here? Well, maybe if we were our own nation and not a place where just anybody can come like it’s some kinda dumping ground for all of America’s rejects then perhaps we wouldn’t be having such issues.

Yes. Strong immigration enforcement is important. But that doesn't clean up the streets, prevent people from doing drugs and shitting in public, or police crime in homeless encampments. 

&gt;It just seems like CA is heading in one direction while the rest of the country is going the opposite way. 

That's not true. Housing prices have been going up. Crime rates have been going up. Substance abuse and suicide rates have been going up. We're headed in the same direction as everyone else.

Which man?

&gt; one ten-millionth the distance from the equator to the North Pole.

Earth-centric is better than Human-centric because as implied above, not all humans are the same, but we can all reference the one Earth.

&gt; 0 degrees Fahrenheit is around when people die, 100 degrees Fahrenheit is also around where people die.

Not an accurate measurement: I've survived working outside on days that were 100+ degrees as well as below-zero. By this measurement, I should be dead at least twice, and because I'm not, we can say, reasonably, that this is not a reliable measurement whereas water will always freeze at zero-C and boil at 100-C given normal-enough circumstances.

&gt; A Liter is a cubic decimeter of water... if that doesn't mean much to you, well remember a decimeter is just one-hundred-millionth the distance from equator to the North Pole, so a liter is a cube that measures one decimeter on a side.

One litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram. The cool thing about Metric is that the units are related, whereas in Imperial, you have to do more complex math to convert.

&gt; An Cup is a cup of coffee. A Pint is a glass of water. An Ounce is about one gulp. Table and Teaspoons are... 

This reminds me of that [anecdote about the first Polish dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowe_Ateny) that said under the entry for ""horse"" that ""everyone knows what a horse is."" It's not really a good definition or a reliably repeatable measurement. Who's glass? Who's gulp?

Even if you can't do all those things to re-determine what exactly a meter is in relation to the Earth or a kilogram / centimeter / etc, that just puts it on equal footing with the Imperial system, making Metric, at its *worst* equal to Imperial; and, at best, *better*",2022-07-17 13:31:37,2022-07-17 13:31:37

igkqowy,LetMeNotHear,"&gt;A foot is... about the length of a man's foot in a shoe.

Most people's feet are not a foot. There's enough human variance that to refer to something as 100 feet long could mean two *very* different measurements to two people with different feet. That's why people don't actually use their foot as a comparison, they just know how long the unit is. Like how people do with meters.

&gt;A meter is the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum in 3.33564095e-9 of a second, or if you have trouble wrapping your head around that, it's one ten-millionth the distance from the equator to the North Pole.

Yeah, but again, people don't actually use that. It's solid rationale for the basis of a unit, but people just remember the unit. Like they do with feet. I can say this with confidence, because I hail from England; the dreaded land where we use *both* systems.

&gt;0 degrees Celsius is when water freezes, 100 degrees Celsius is when water boils... cool.

This actually is a good system. You know that if it's below zero, there's probably going to be snow. And you generally know how cold snow is. And if something's over 100, you know it's as hot as boiling water. Again, a temperature most people are (unfortunately) familiar with.

&gt;0 degrees Fahrenheit is around when people die, 100 degrees Fahrenheit is also around where people die.

No. You don't get to do this. Your whole spiel is about the origins of the units, so lets bring up Fahrenheit's. The zero point for which is the freezing point of... brine. A solution of water, ice and ammonium chloride. That's not even the salt that makes most brines that people know about (that would be sodium chloride). That's completely fucking arbitrary and useless to most people. The upper limit is 90 (why not 100, Fahrenheit, you stupid fuck) and is based on an *incorrect* value of human body temperature. So you have the freezing and boiling points of one of the most common and important materials in existence vs the freezing point of an obscure solution and a mistake. Lol. Also, 100F is not when people die. Have you heard of the middle east? Arabia? India? Stays over 100F for weeks or months on end.

&gt;A Liter is a cubic decimeter of water... if that doesn't mean much to you, well remember a decimeter is just one-hundred-millionth the distance from equator to the North Pole, so a liter is a cube that measures one decimeter on a side.

This feature of metric is actually *insanely* useful. Makes it real easy to figure out how much fluid can fit in a container if you know its dimensions. Something's 1m by 1m by 1m? Ten litres of water, it can contain. How much is that fluid gonna weigh? 10 kilos. Easy peasy. What about imperial? Something's 1 cubic foot, it can contain 6.22884 fluid ounces... And it'll weigh 62.43 pounds. Christ. No way anyone who isn't a savant is doing *that* on the fly.

&gt;An Cup is a cup of coffee. A Pint is a glass of water. An Ounce is about one gulp. Table and Teaspoons are...

Metric is equally intuitive to those who live with it. Your mistaking *your own familiarity* with a system with its *innate intuitiveness.* I can say confidently that I can easily picture 300 ml, a litre or whatever else.

And then how do you handle exits and on-ramps in the left lane? That means you'd need a bicycle bridge for each of these that go the main path. And even then you'd have to consider the clearance required for vehicles passing under these.

And it's not just the cost of the initial building of these paths, there's also the continued maintenance, which depending on where you live and how your city/county/state handles maintenance, they might easily end up in a state of disrepair and become dangerous, to the point where bicyclists are at risk of falling into traffic.

I think your view is a noble one, but I just don't think it's feasible or beneficial. Highways are built to accommodate thousands of cars per day, and adding a path to accommodate maybe a couple hundred at most bicycles will just add an incredible cost without much added benefit.

igmza1r,Birb-Brain-Syn,"I'm not sure what would change your view here. The main comparison seems to be that wanting vapes banned is hypocritical, but this seems to be on the presumption these same people want ciggarettes to remain legal.

The truth is, we know both are bad for you. We have 100+ years of research showing the effects of ciggarettes over massive populations. We have less than 20 years of wide-spread vape use, and manufacturing differs wildly based on flavour and design. There are class-action cases going through the courts as I type this. Would learning the Vape's are actually more harmful than ciggarettes or alcohol change your opinion?

The main reason we don't ban alcohol isn't because it's unsafe, but because so many people rely on it. Prohibition showed people are willing to fight, cheat, lie and steal for their fix of alcohol. We surmise that people will similarly do the same for niccotine, but at least we have ways of administering niccotine that are comparatively healthy. Whilst in your anecdotal experience you used vapes to wean yourself off ciggarettes - what if you had used niccotine patches instead? Would that have been better?

Looking at things objectively, e-ciggarettes may or may not provide a bigger over-all cost than ciggarettes. We know that they produce more waste, and we have good reason to think they are dangerous in similar ways. We allow people to do dangerous things for the sake of liberty. Are we trading too much liberty for the sake of health? Are we not protecting health enough for a pointless liberty? Are there better alternatives available?",2022-07-18 06:07:57,2022-07-18 06:07:57

ignhheb,alfihar,"“In metric, one milliliter of water occupies one cubic centimeter, weighs one gram, and requires one calorie of energy to heat up by one degree centigrade—which is 1 percent of the difference between its freezing point and its boiling point. An amount of hydrogen weighing the same amount has exactly one mole of atoms in it. Whereas in the American system, the answer to ‘How much energy does it take to boil a room-temperature gallon of water?’ is ‘Go fuck yourself,’ because you can’t directly relate any of those quantities.”

― Josh Bazell, Wild Thing

First off do you mean imperial units or US units... because the us and imperial measurements are different.. while metric is metric everywhere. 

""A foot is... about the length of a man's foot in a shoe.""

Almost no ones feet are this length. The percentage of people in the US with 304.8mm feet us less than a percent.

""The most frequently occurring length class for male customers was 270 mm for scans in North America and Europe, and 255 mm in Asia. For female customers, it was 245 mm for scans in North America and Europe, and 235 mm in Asia.""

With shoes? What shoes?  Boots? High Heels? Sneakers? Mexican Pointy Shoes.

Have you EVER confidently measured something accurately with a shoe? 

Cups... are you talking 1 US customary cup or 1 US ""legal"" cup?  Pint?  Are we talking Imperial pint or US pint or Dry Pint?

The imperial gallon, quart, pint, cup and gill are approximately 20% larger than their US counterparts, meaning these are not interchangeable, but the imperial fluid ounce is only approximately 4% smaller than the US fluid ounce, meaning these are often used interchangeably.

A US gallon is defined as 231 cubic inches.  If that doesnt mean much to you remember that 

The distance from the Equator to either the North Pole or the South Pole is approximately 49,720 furlongs. Multiply by 10 works out to 497,200 chains and then multiply by 4 to get rods which is 1988800, then simply multiply by 16.5 giving us 32815200 feet. All that is required is an easy division by 12 and then multiplication by 231

Another way one could visualise it is that 231 inches is 16632 points(the smallest unit of measure typography) or 1386 picas.",2022-07-18 08:21:11,2022-07-18 08:21:11

ignwgjf,fargmania,"It comes down to intent. The reasoning behind that intent isn't relevant to whether the offer was genuine, because even as a test the offer stands. What is a first date besides a series of tests anyways? It's often like a job interview - you are testing for compatibility. I myself have a bunch of tests in that scenario. Can I make her laugh, and can she make me laugh? Does she speak derisively or judgmentally about me or other people? Is she polite to the waiter, or rude to the waiter? Is there an awkwardness to physical touch, or are we feeling comfortable with casual contact? For me the right answers to these questions are signs of mutual compatibility, and yes they will affect my decision about a second date. So what you are describing is someone using money as a test. That's a turn off for me... but some guys probably don't mind being that ATM machine that some women look for. Also I am usually one to pay for dinner if I organize the dinner, but I'm a total skinflint in my day-to-day life... so it's probably not actually a great test lol. I personally wouldn't expect money issues to come up in the first date, but if a woman wants to put that priority front and center, then I'm happy to be done with her. Money is one of those things that no two people have a matching opinion on... and I've dealt with enough people in my life being weird about money that I don't need another one.

So to conclude... first dates are always about tests... and in my opinion being your genuine self is the best way to be in a first date... you aren't trying to win a prize (unless you are trying for a one night stand I guess). You are trying to establish compatibility. If she genuinely believes that a man taking up her offer to pay is grounds for immediate dismissal, be grateful that she was so honest with you, and that you didn't get mixed up in her off-putting brand of reality. But I'd say her offer is genuine - she sees it as one of the prices she is willing to pay to hone in on a single category of man to the exclusion of all others. I'd say the offer is very genuine.",2022-07-18 10:00:05,2022-07-18 10:00:05
igo0qjb,jackalnapesjudsey,"I don’t entirely disagree but I do think you’re perhaps attaching too much emotion to this act by calling it “completely fake”. 

Social etiquette is complex, and while your current romantic partner says that if you agreed to split the bill that would mean you’re cheap, that is unlikely to be the case for everyone.

For example, where I live (the UK), there’s kind of an unspoken social etiquette where If someone offers you a cup of tea/food etc in their home, you are supposed to initially politely refuse. The host then insists/encourages, and you finally accept. Works the same way when you have people working in your home, like labourers - it’s rude not to offer, but it’s rude for them to immediately accept. The whole “I said no to a cup of tea and they believed me and I didn’t get one” is kind of a meme here.

Is this a bit silly? Sure. Does it occasionally result in people not getting what they want? Sure. But are people being “completely fake” when they partake in this social etiquette rule? I would say no, they’re sincerely trying to be polite.

For hetero couples, the social etiquette here may still be in flux. Some people genuinely want to split the bill - I’m a lesbian so I’ve never found any rules surrounding this in my dating life. I’m sure many straight women are genuine about fairly splitting the bill but just don’t want another date regardless. Others might believe it falls on the initiator. And again, others might believe it’s socially expected to offer but that really the man doesn’t want them to split - its a dance to make everyone feel comfortable. They might expect you to refuse because they believe it’s the accepted social rule in their culture. And you can absolutely believe that it’s silly or unfair, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the other party is fake and rude. To them, you may have broken a social convention and that may give pause for thought.",2022-07-18 10:28:20,2022-07-18 10:28:20

So let's say you do have an audience of sorts, I can see two clear cases where I would find it acceptable to argue against the person themselves rather than just their ideas, the first being if the person in question is an actual political candidate who will hold office if they win, in which case the kind of person they are very much does matter not just the ideas they say

The second case is much harder to discern, since you never truly know what is in someone's head, but when you believe someone is not arguing in good faith, things like attacking Straw Men they know good and well is not your position, the classic gish gallop, the I'm just asking questions despite very obviously implying the answers, and many other such tactics turn any attempt at reasonable discussion of ideas into a farce and this needs to be pointed out because they are incredibly dishonest but effective tools of persuasion and you can't really point that out without stating or at the very least implying dishonesty on the person you are arguing with",2022-07-18 10:46:20,2022-07-18 10:46:20

Tiktok and social media stars are different from the head of government. Putin either gained or seized power and built his cult of personality after he had power. Social media stars gain popularity without using or taking the power of the government.

Yeah, Trump was in fact impeached before January 6th. He was impeached not because he was an ""illegitimate president"" but because he solicited foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election to help his re-election bid, and then obstructed the inquiry.

igoqtum,ImJustHereForCorn,"All of these are wrong! You listen to both sides of the story, not just one.

When a fire happens, the firefighters don't just put out the fire and listen to the homeowner who said it was an accident, they go and investigate the wreckage and look at the whole story. Insurance gets out there, investigators, etc. They get a whole picture; they don't just believe one side and call it a day. ""Ope! Homeowner said so, so we have to believe em or only listen to them."" 

Both the victim and the accused need their stories examined with as much possible evidence. Even witness testimonies are shaky at best, since people's minds are not steel traps and can remember every detail or everything correctly. There are numerous court cases where a false testimony has put innocent people away, stories came up wrong in an appeal or retrial, stories of witnesses changed from the initial police interview to being up on the stand as a witness, etc. 

Now there is indeed a bias in our society and in the justice system AGAINST men. When a man claims or reports being a victim of sexual assault or even rape. In fact, men are more likely to be victims of rape in the US (SOURCE - [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2449454/More-men-raped-US-women-including-prison-sexual-abuse.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2449454/More-men-raped-US-women-including-prison-sexual-abuse.html))

This article also shows the staggering numbers that women commit sexual assault [https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/)

Yet there are almost ZERO resources for men to go to when they are victims and the hypocrisy shows in society, where even the media won't cover it, they'll downplay it, or even society will say things like ""he must've enjoyed it."" 

So no, we should listen to ALL sides of the story, not just ONE. So, your statement is wrong OP, it should be we listen to all the facts before passing judgement and only believing one side of the story. All too often does the public or the media reach a conclusion only 24 hours after an initial report, claiming the accused is guilty, when no one even has all the facts, and a trial has even yet been held.

No because you're simply changing the way you say it. Even the message ""Listen to accusers"" takes out the other half of listen to the accused. Why's it so hard to just go ""Listen to both sides of the story""?  Why advocate for one side over the other? All you're doing is putting the message that all you should listen to is one side over the other, when you need all sides of the story to get an accurate description of the events of an evening.

If a group is beyond all logical thinking and is refusing to listen to reason or any other opinion, ostracizing isn't bad not are you cutting yourself off from an opposing viewpoint. Cults are a good example too.

Take for example that trend on tiktok where anti-vaxxers were sticking magnets to their arms to prove that there were chips in the vaccines, and some of which listened to pro-vaxxers explain the science, logic, and reasoning for the lack of sticking, or how one's sweat could briefly make it stick. 

There were two kinds of opposing opinions that happened here. One person listened, compared it to their own knowledge and opinion, and eventually confirmed that perhaps it was silly to think there were chips in the vaccines. Not impossible, obviously, but unlikely in the one they had received. That is the proper way to engage with differing opinions, their mindset didn't change 100% but they were able to draw a conclusion that meant they also did not 100% agree with their original opinion. These are the people everyone likes to talk to and have educated discussions with, i.e. basically this reddit.

Now on the flip side of that, there was a creator who would come up with every excuse under the sun to make their opinion 100% right everything, disregarding any arguments. Sweat is why it stuck a little? Nope, they supposedly barely sweat or swore they wiped their arm beforehand. Oh you don't believe that? Okay, they'll wipe their arm again and try the magnet one more time. Okay, now all of a sudden the magent doesn't stick? Obviously the chip is buried to far in the muscle now, that explains it. Everyone else is wrong no matter what.

These are people of whom no one should argue with because they are deadset on their opinion and opinion only despite being given logical reasons. The difference here is that they have NO intent to change their mind, even if they are wrong.

And this is why they get ostracized. Usually it's not purposeful but some times it is. Human beings can only argue so long until the other person has built themselves a personal echo chamber you can't break through. Then at that point it makes sense to not focus your attention on those people nor listen to them when you talk to someone wuth similar opinions who is open to actual discussion.

Name-calling is just what happens when people get frustrated, although sometimes some people have to just be called out for what they are, ""attack"" their person.

I'm not sure I have a clear absolute GOAT, in my mind.  But, I don't even have any burger places in the running.  Here's my list of contenders (note: I haven't bothered to look up how widespread these chains are, some might be more regional than I thought):

1.  Chipotle:  Great salsa, their chicken is near perfect, amazing guac.  Lots of options that are all good to make a large group happy.  Good vegetarian options.

2.  Potbelly's: Great shakes, the pickled peppers are addictive, their toasting has the temperature and timing perfect.

3.  Firehouse Subs:  The meat is sliced thinner than any other deli place I've been to, there's always a selection of new hot sauces to try (they are well marked for their spiciness level so you know what you are getting into).  Proceeds are donated to support fire and rescue units.

4.  Cava: The only chain I know of where I can get decent falafel, hummus, or baba ganoush (even if they don't call it that), lentils that make all other lentils I've ever had pale in comparison.  They also make an effort to use biodegradable packaging and they are one of the only chains I've seen consistently get rid of marking ""Men's"" and ""Women's"" on single stall bathrooms.  Good vegetarian options.

5. Noodles &amp; Company: PASTA! Decent spread of different culinary traditions all at a decent quality.  Seriously, someone did fast food pasta.  Good vegetarian options.  Have I mentioned that I love pasta?

If I really dug into it, I might be able to think of some more to add to the list.  But, as you might notice no one who serves burgers makes my list.  No one that I've tried is even close.  I can imagine a place that does burgers but also has some other options beating these out in theory, but I'm not willing to give that to a place that only serves burgers.

2: Motivation to vote stems from perceived issue importance as well as belief that a politician can interact with that issue. [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260850/).

These are peer-reviewed, highly cited studies. They are also very long. Feel free to take a look at the conclusion if you don't want to scour through the methods and discussion.

#Why attack instead of debate?

&gt; First, why not debate? Isn't that rational, and makes the person you're arguing with more likely to change sides? 

The issue with debating is that you're specifically focusing on changing 1 person's mind, and it usually takes a very long time. Take your example, Darryl Davis. Over around 30 years (1983-2016), Darryl collected ""25 or 26 robes."" Impactful, yes, but less than 1 convert per year isn't very high. Debating is most useful when it's (a) broadcast to a larger audience and (b) utilized to challenge members of a dwindling organization (like the KKK). When it comes to enacting systemic change, debating is generally too limited in scope and too slow. Codifying Roe v. Wade won't happen by slowly converting individual people over decades.

&gt; Second, why attack? Doesn't that seem counterintuitive?

What's important here is that you're portraying a message to people *you're not debating*. I've already established that emotion and perceived issue importance are powerful motivators. Let's take the following examples:

**Scenario 1:** Larry Pro-Life and Carol Pro-Choice get in a debate over abortion. Let's say 10 or so undecided voters see the beginning of this discussion. Carol Pro-Choice avoids attacking Larry Pro-Life personally, and says that his beliefs are harmful. This doesn't convey a sense of importance, nor does it elicit emotion from onlookers. As a result, it's likely that none of the 10 people will change their vote over this interaction. Over around a year, Carol Pro-Choice convinces Larry Pro-Life that abortion should be legal, and Larry Pro-Life votes for a candidate that wants to codify Roe v. Wade. Total new votes for Roe v. Wade: 2 (-1 to +1). 



**Scenario 2:** Carol Pro-Choice notes that Larry Pro-Life thinks that 10-year-olds should be forced to give birth to their rapist's baby. Let's say 10 or so undecided voters see this interaction. Carol Pro-Choice claims ""Larry Pro-Life is a bad person! He believes that 10-year-olds should be forced to give birth to their rapist's baby! He's going to vote for politicians that support this."" This does two things; (1) elicits an emotional response from onlookers and (2) gives a perceived importance to an issue. It's an emotional argument meant to elicit an emotional response. Remember, this motivates people to vote; see the sources I provided. Let's say of those 10 undecided voters, 5 of them are angry at this. ""Hey!"" they might say. ""That person is voting to make sure that 10-year-olds have to give birth to their rapist's baby! That's an abhorrent belief! I'm going to make sure his vote is counteracted by mine."" Total new votes for Roe v. Wade: 4 (5 from onlookers, -1 from Larry). 

Even if only half of a small group of onlookers are emotionally impacted by this argument (that's purely passion-based), that's still twice as effective as a debate when it comes to voting. Emotional arguments are logically fallacious, but they are *very* effective. People vote when they want to make a difference, and ""that person is a bad person, and will vote for people who support the bad ideologies he supports"" is a good motivator. 

#TL:DR 

The point of those claims isn't to convince the person who makes those claims. The point of those claims is to convince apathetic or undecided onlookers to make a stance against them. [Emotional arguments](https://www.orfonline.org/research/emotions-and-vote-choice-perspectives-from-the-us-and-india/) that highlight the [importance of an issue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260850/) are effective at convincing people to vote, and personal attacks against a person with abhorrent beliefs happen to be a very effective way of doing this.",2022-07-18 15:33:19,2022-07-18 15:33:19
igpgdio,EpsilonRose,"&gt; But, I think by doing so it’s important to understand that while it may help you and your personal well being and state of mind, I’m not convinced it furthers causes that you believe in. It doesn’t advance any way forward as a country. 

Counterpoint: engaging with them requires you to spend an incredible amount of time and energy, that could be used for something else; has an incredibly low expected  return (you *maybe* convince one person, but probably not); and a significant potential for a negative return (there was a major problem with news networks legitimizing climate change deniers by inviting them on to debate scientists, implicitly placing the two views on the same level, even if the scientist wiped the floor with them).

By refusing to engage, you prevent those potential negative outcomes and free up that time and energy for activities with higher potential returns. As such, by refusing to engage, you do more to help your cause and the country.",2022-07-18 16:14:23,2022-07-18 16:14:23
igpmjtn,LosingPatients,"How would you handle interchanges? Lots of on-ramps and exits? You'd have to build infrastructure for bicyclists to both go past these unharmed as well as paths that accommodate them continuing on the freeway without crossing through traffic. That means every single exit and on-ramp would need both a path to continue along the freeway along with a path to follow the off-ramp. 

And then how do you handle exits and on-ramps in the left lane? That means you'd need a bicycle bridge for each of these that go the main path. And even then you'd have to consider the clearance required for vehicles passing under these.

And it's not just the cost of the initial building of these paths, there's also the continued maintenance, which depending on where you live and how your city/county/state handles maintenance, they might easily end up in a state of disrepair and become dangerous, to the point where bicyclists are at risk of falling into traffic.

I think your view is a noble one, but I just don't think it's feasible or beneficial. Highways are built to accommodate thousands of cars per day, and adding a path to accommodate maybe a couple hundred at most bicycles will just add an incredible cost without much added benefit.

Also, as someone who spend a lot of time getting around using a bicycle as a kid/teenager in a suburban/urban area, it was always faster to just go through city streets... highways/freeways are build to get vehicles from one point to another as quickly as possible without being burdened by traffic lights, stop-signs, speed-limits, etc. The main benefit is that I can drive 60+ miles an hour to get from one place to another at the cost of having to travel a couple extra miles. A bicyclist isn't really hindered by speed limits as they're usually far above how fast a cyclist can go(10-20 mph), and depending on the area can easily cross roads without being bound by stop signs and traffic lights.

---

Yea I wasn't sure how convincing the cost-effectiveness argument would be.

But I kind of glossed over the most effective point. The main benefit of the highway is high-speed travel with no stopping needed.

In order to utilize a freeway, I would most likely have to travel *away* from my destination to get to the on-ramp and then go along the route of the highway which is probably more miles than had I went straight there and end up a mile or several miles away from my destination at the exit, whereas if I drove there through city/town roads I would've driven a shorter distance, but would've had to deal with lower speed limits, traffic lights, and other things that come with it. 

So for a driver, using freeways is a trade-off of traveling a longer distance but at a higher speed(less time) vs a shorter distance at a lower speed(more time), even if that difference is just a matter of miles. A bicyclist doesn't really benefit from the higher speeds that a driver is able to utilize on a freeway and is just left with the drawback of more distance to their destination. 

Maybe it's different in your area, but as an example in my area we don't have heavy pedestrian traffic and generally cyclists are free to use the sidewalk as well as the road, and in order to access our main interstate you have to literally start climbing a mountain, as we live in a valley and our main highway is an interstate that goes along the length of the outskirts of the valley with a bunch of expressways as arteries feeding into it. In order to get from one area to another via highway, you'd have to ride several miles uphill, follow X amount of miles to your destinations exit, travel several more miles away from the exit to get to your destination, or you could just go from point A to point B and go a distance equal to X or less.",2022-07-17 23:53:28,2022-07-18 17:00:28
igpr8eq,Li-renn-pwel,"It seems you have been made aware that you are confusing cultural appropriation and culture appreciation at this point. I am going to answer your question “What is the harm?” for cultural appropriation instead of explaining the difference between the two. So there are three ‘types’ of CA (cultural appropriation) and they each harm a culture in different ways. 

1. Columbusing: This is when someone claims to have invented things that someone else has already invented. It is essentially violating a cultural copyright. There was one lady who posted a recipe of a noodle recipe that she claimed to have invented herself but was very obviously pho. This sort of thing is harmful because it removes the history of that item. It leads to cultures being perceived as having not contributing things. For example, a lot of Southern food is actually Indigenous food such as hushpuppies. Yet I have literally been told by people that there is not Indigenous cuisine because we were “killed off before they had a chance to create a cuisine”.

2. Mislabeling: This is more or less the opposite of the above. Someone takes an item, concept, practice from a culture that they think is cool or has a certain ‘vibe’ and puts it on a (sometimes) similar thing. One example is a WASP woman inviting her friends to a sauna where they drink wine and listen to relaxing music but calling it a sweatlodge. A sweatlodge is a very sacred ceremony among many Indigenous people of Turtle Island (North America). No one is saying that this lady can’t hang out with her friends in a sauna but why call it a sweatlodge when it has almost nothing in common with it? In this case it likely would have been done because attaching Indigenous imagery to something makes it seem spiritual and close to nature (due to stereotypes about Indigenous people). This is harmful because it actually makes it harder for people to connect with their own culture. I can’t simply google “sweatlodges near me” because so many of them are run by plastic shamans (people who appropriate Indigenous religions). It also makes it difficult for others to learn about it because they usually can’t tell when something is authentic and when it is a mislabeling.

3. Just the usual racist kind: this is when you reduce all of a culture into a trope or character. Did you know that there are over 300 different Indigenous nations in American and Canada? Because often in media if there is an indigenous character they are a mash up of whatever features non-indigenous people think are cool. You might get them having a Plain’s war bonnet, Mohawk hairstyles, Cree beadwork while speaking Cherokee words. This is obviously harmful in the same way any other kind of racism is.


ETA: okay, I guess the differences between appropriation and appreciation were not as well explained as I had thought… aside from columbusing, which is a purposeful theft, for something to be CA it must be something that is sacred, a closed practice, something earned, etc. Food is something a lot of SJW throw up as CA but I can’t think of any food I know personally that would count for that. When I have the example of hush puppies, I was not saying non-indigenous folks can’t eat hush puppies, I was pointing out that the miss-attribution of them have lead to their origin being erased and the Indigenous contribution  to American food culture being overlooked. There are plenty of parts of Indigenous culture that others can freely enjoy.

An example that more people might understand is Christian communion. There are lots of aspects of Christian religion and culture that others can freely enjoy and participate. Non Christian’s can listen to Christian music, eat food traditionally associated with Christian holidays and even attend church. However, with a few exceptions, the unbaptized cannot partake in communion. Some denominations, such as Catholics, require you to be part of their church to and/or in ‘full communion’ to partake. Communion is a very sacred part of the religion and for some, once blessed, is the literal blood and flesh of their god. It’s not that the entire religion/culture is closed for people but that there are a few that can only be done if you are part of the community or invited into it.",2022-07-18 17:35:11,2022-07-18 17:35:11
igprq3x,ItAintFamiliah,"Another word for the queer community is GRSM - gender/romantic/sexual minority. Asexual people are a sexual orientation minority.

&gt; Being asexual is more of a romantic preference.

Being asexual has nothing to do with romantic orientation or preference. Nor is it a preference in any regard. It quite simply means that someone does not experience sexual attraction to *anyone*. They may still be romantically attracted to people.

&gt; Sure, they may have been told they are weird and don't belong, but its definitely not the same struggles as homosexual and transgender people face.

I don't feel that an identity's validity for existing in a community should be determined by the average amount of pain and struggle they go through because of it. Besides, some trans person might grow up in a completely accepting and loving environment while an asexual somewhere else is being forced into an arranged marriage or heavily pressured into having sex while never knowing what's ""wrong"" with them. But again, in my view their struggle shouldn't mean anything in this argument anyways.

Also, if you consider the community's history to be important than here's worth considering: bisexuals historically welcomed asexuals into the community because they also were technically 'equally attracted to both/all genders'.

But anyways I believe that most anyone who's a gender, sexual, or romantic minority should be welcome in the queer community if they wish to identify as such.",2022-07-18 17:38:49,2022-07-18 17:38:49

igq2cv9,LetMeNotHear,"Easier? Incredibly hard to say. The ease or difficulty of something like dating is multifaceted. However, the claim that neither sex has an advantage is wrong. Depending on what you'd accept as an advantage. There are numerous factors, most of which come down in the favour of one sex or the other.

If we consider ""having a larger percentage of those you are interested in being interested in you,"" to be an advantage, the numbers are in and women have the leg up by quite a way. If we consider ""being considered more attractive to the opposite sex than they are to your sex,"" to be an advantage, that also comes down in favour of women, though I personally believe that it's not a separate advantage, rather just the cause of the first.

If we're talking about ""likelihood to contract a disease/the disease's severity,"" men have the leg up there. HPV, as far as I'm aware only causes cancer in women. Same goes for ""likelihood of experiencing pain during sex"" (though that is self reported, and machismo may be fudging the numbers for the blokes slightly).

But the crucial thing to note here is what ""these people"" you're talking about are actually arguing. I don't think they're arguing that in *every facet* of dating, woman have an easier time than men. I'm sure some people, somewhere think this, though. But from the multiple posts on this topic that I've seen on this sub, they seem to be arguing only for the existence of the first advantage; that women have an easier time finding someone who'll take interest. Usually, because it is the stage *they* are stuck at; finding someone who's interested. Call it ""acquisition advantage"" if you want. But either way, men and women have plenty of advantages over each other when it comes to dating.

It can be make or break. What are you going to think about the game when you can't get past level one? People generally focus on the obstacle directly ahead of them, not the ones they've already cleared. Many of those folks take an attitude of ""sure you've got problems at the 60m mark but I can't even get on the starting line. I'd *kill* to have *your* problems.""

I'm mixing metaphors quite a bit, but I hope it was still intelligible.

---

Very much so. I studied this stuff. It's a principle called anisogamy. That is the asymmetry in minimum parental investment, which emerged as a feature of the dimorphism in our gametes.

With most mammals, the minimum investment for the father to sire an heir is about 20 minutes of legwork. Easy peasy. Of course, this means that the optimum strategy for them to embark on is quantity. The more get you have, the more likely your genes will proliferate. Mothers on the other hand, are tied down for quite a while, sinking valuable time and resources on their get, of which they can have maybe a handful before a sabretooth eats them or they die from a splinter infection or something else prehistoric. So their optimum strategy is quality; pick the best potential father for your heirs as any time wasted on sub-par genetic material hurts your chances.

It's actually a really interesting topic, and one I can tell I've probably gone into too much detail on already. But regardless, the fact that the difference is natural and old does not mean it does not exist. These guys are wrong about the how but they're (somewhat) right about the what. In humans, ""acquisition advantage"" isn't nearly as steep as it is in manatees (top dog gets *all* the ladies and most males die with no offspring), but it is present in a lesser capacity.

It's important to note that engaging with a bad faith actor is only useful insofar as to show how they are acting in bad faith or to embarass them so that they can not move others to their positions with their disinformation and perceived superiority. What you're referring to about 'attacking identity' sounds like you're referring to an 'ad hominem' attack...basically saying that someone's argument is bad because THEY - for some reason - are bad. You're right...this is not effective and it's a bad faith move used to not engage with an argument...HOWEVER...if you've engaged with the arguments and you've pinpointed where a person is simply ignoring objective reality that's in front of their face...you MUST call out that this is a flaw of theirs and that they are not capable of moving the discussion forward in a productive good faith way. Otherwise you're being played.

It's good you want to engage and have productive conversations...but a lot of these people don't...they just don't care about finding the truth the way you do. Your insistence that we shouldn't stop engaging with these people is harmful if you take it too far.

It's useful to embarass a fascist and make him look weak. Fascism requires that you appear strong even though you really are not. Breaking down the ""strongman"" persona and exposing the weakness within is important to prevent the movement from growing, BUT in order to do this the person engaging has to know enough to actually do this and they have to know exactly when they need to move on and mock the fascist for their weakness and push them out of society. If you can not achieve that goal...do not engage publicly with a fascist...they will use you to make themselves look stronger.

Think of Richard Spencer. He went around putting up his strong intellectual white supremacist bravado and won over other weak white supremacists who wanted to feel strong like him. Once he was embarassed publicly and had his crybaby bitch boy fit he was pushed aside and no one wanted anything else to do with him. If you haven't heard that audio clip of him losing his shit after Charlottesville then you should go give it a listen. It shows exactly why believing in white supremacy makes you weak; The belief that white people are inherently better than others and that their rightful place is on top will ALWAYS be proven wrong because there are people outside the group who are better than them...always will be...and when they get bested...that recording of Spencer is what you get...an angry little child raging about how ""I am supposed to RULE them! They can't do THIS to ME!"" because all they have is a fantasy. This is why they resort to violence...when they aren't actually better than you they just have to get rid of you so they don't have to see you being human...being good...defying their fantasy.

You can engage with them up to a point, but you're going to reach a point where logic, reason, and facts stop mattering.

My point is if Alaska was the be all, end all place to live in the US it would at least be competitive in population, and not the very bottom of the charts.

I think it makes it clear that Alaska is at least not attractive enough to pull any serious consideration from the general populace as a desirable place to live, regardless of reasoning.

Currency is bit different. Normally from context you know we are talking about money when you encounter a number but not always. Like if I list content of my backpack or shopping list then it would be useful to have it listed as ""Item: Quantity"" instead of ""Quantity: Item"" because you would always have to read the item first before the quantity to understand what you are looking for.

igqn4o3,runawaytoaster,"As someone who lives here and loves this state these are a few of the things that make life challenging here that other people may not want to put up with. In terms of cost of living this is a rough state to be a young person trying to make a start for yourself, average rent is 1600 a month before you factor in heating costs which run an average of 200 bucks. and you need to make an average of 50,000 a year to live independently. If you dont have a skillset where that is possible and you dont have a support network up here already this is a rough place to be someone just starting out due to cost of living. 

Our roads are in constant need of repair no matter where you are going there is likely to be extensive roadwork except in the winter which brings its own challenges. Lots of the remote parts of the road system in Alaska even the highways dont have reliable cell phone coverage. You have to accept and plan for the reality that if your car breaks down in the middle of winter you aren't just temporarily inconvenienced you could be in an immediate survival situation. Some roads can be blocked entirely by avalanches in the winter. I used to split my time between Valdez and Anchorage the trip back and forth was 300ish miles each way. Every time before I left I would call and check with the weather station see if the passes were clear of avalanches. If they weren't I could be stuck in valdez several days long than I planned. 

Vehicles up here are expensive. They are expensive everywhere now but it costs money to bring them up here the market of used car sellers is smaller so getting reliable transportation can be spendy. 

On the subject of guns. Those are more expensive to up here and anything you want shipped from the states whether its from gunbroker or just another ffl you should expect to pay upwards of 100 dollars in shipping alone.",2022-07-18 21:52:51,2022-07-18 21:52:51

igs30vb,zeratul98,"&gt;corruption and lobbying powers who influence where the dollars actually go is the issue. 

Right. That's part of the point here. Money is power, and extreme wealth is extreme power. The kind of extreme power that breaks democracies. Taxing the hell out of the ultra wealthy isn't really meant to raise all that much money, it's meant to a) reduce the extreme amount of wealth, and thus power, they have and b) discourage the kinds of behaviors that lead to extreme wealth

For point b), let's about this a bit more. It's unlikely one gets extremely wealthy, like billionaire wealthy, without exploiting people. Walmart is a great example of a company that does this. They deliberately hire more part time workers rather than fewer full time to avoid paying them benefits. They exploit their workers, and the rest of the country foots the bill by paying for their workers' food stamps. Now, would the family that owns Walmart still do all this shit if they only got to keep 10 cents of every dollar they saved Walmart? How about 5 cents? Taxes on extreme wealth and income make this kind of exploitative profiteering less attractive. The benefit isn't the money raised, it's the money saved by not having to subsidize walmart's employees",2022-07-19 07:10:06,2022-07-19 07:10:06

These tax increase proposals are usually very tightly coupled with what they're actually paying for.

It may not pay for the entire proposal, but of the total amount you need, raising taxes on the ultra wealthy is probably going to be the most popular choice, so you should probably start there.

But yes, lobbyists exist and making change is hard. I guess I'm unclear if I disagree with your view or its framing, or if it's so obvious that I'm not sure *anyone* actually disagrees, including the people who think we should raise taxes on the ultra wealthy.

I feel like this didn't really address my point. Bernie Sanders wants to pass a version of Medicare for all paid for by tax increases. If Bernie Sanders could pass his legislation, there would be no question about where the ""more money"" goes. You seem to be envisioning a two step process where first er raise money, and then there's a fight over how to spend it. But this is usually all contained in a single piece of legislation. If the tax increase passes, it's often *already* decide where it goes.

Another way of looking at it is that I'm not sure which ""talking heads"" you're watching that are saying ""if only we had more money"". I don't really understand who's saying that.

igsglpz,badass_panda,"&gt;I’m from a country where air con is pretty much unheard of, and my ambient temperature is between 10-15c. It is currently 30+. I can’t sleep, I feel like I can’t fully relax. My body and mind are afflicted by stress and anxiety which would be easy to manage were it not for the heat.

That sounds like it sucks.

&gt;This is the best season, is it? Give me your most frigid winter and I will thrive. A holiday home on an Icelandic glacier would be ideal.

You wouldn't if you didn't have the ability to warm up your living space... in fact, you'd freeze to death.

Your issue isn't with the season, it's with the fact that you have the ability to create a comfortable atmosphere in one season, but not in the other season -- so of course you prefer the season you're comfortable in.

I'm in a country (the US) where it's highly abnormal not to have efficient air conditioning in your home. In most of the US, it's also very cheap to own (or have access to) outdoor activities that help you cool down (like going to the beach, going to a pool, swimming in a lake or a river, etc). 

As a result, I love the summer! My house is comfortable in the summer and the winter, and I have sports I can enjoy in both seasons -- there's nothing unpleasant about it being hot outside (it is 35 degrees celsius today, where I am) because I only have to deal with it when I *want* to be hot.

If you remove the issue (not having AC) from the equation, I think summer is objectively better:

* More hours of sunlight means more time for any activity that requires it to be light outside.
* There's no snow to shovel or ice to chip off of my windows before I can drive. There's no black ice to cause car crashes or make me slip on my stairs.
* I don't have to wear thick boots and thick gloves and a thick jacket -- dressing is simple, easy and lightweight, and it takes me very little time to get in and out of the house.",2022-07-19 08:39:35,2022-07-19 08:39:35

igsrio3,OrdinaryOk5247,"People should, of course, be able to learn from and grow from the mistakes they make. All life should not be a purity test, and the majority of people in society understand this. But I do want to be careful about something here.

I had a trans friend describe to me once why she was in a bad mood. It was a lot of little things-- all she had done that day was wake up, get dressed, grab a coffee, and walk to class. But she had already been misgendered four times. No single one of these instances were from someone who meant real harm-- they were innocent mistakes from flawed people who, when corrected, apologized. But by the fourth person my friend was frustrated, and tired of defining who she was all the time.

Its these sorts of little things that can really weigh on a person. Even if the person making the comment means well, and even if the comment is barely offensive, it gets tiring. From the perspective of the person committing the offense, its just a little thing which they can learn from. But for the person receiving the offense, that might be fifth little thing they've experienced in the last twenty minutes.

This is the much-maligned concept of ""microaggressions."" The narrative goes that people these days have to walk on eggshells because they're too afraid to make a microaggression. But, when microaggressions pile up in one person, they don't seem so micro anymore. They seem (and often actually are) indicative of a broader cultural attitude that does not care about that person's comfort or safety.

So, yes, its fine for people to make mistakes and learn from them. But if the person who is harmed-- even slightly-- by those mistakes has an apparent overreaction, or if it puts them in a sour mood, or if they just don't really want to interact with the person making the mistakes, please understand why. Their life experience is not limited to this one mistake, and it can be exceedingly frustrating to be everyone else's learning experience.

That does not excuse media-driven character assassinations-- though I would argue that most examples of ""cancel culture"" have had very little long term effects for the canceled person, that's a different post. But I hope it does help partly explain some of the very real and strong frustrations that marginalized folks often feel when confronted with a seemingly minor faux pas from a well-meaning person. Its not that these frustrations are new, its that we are finally moving towards a place where the people who feel these frustrations are able to talk openly about them in a way that is actually listened to by the groups of people making the mistakes.",2022-07-19 09:47:51,2022-07-19 09:47:51

&gt; * beg him, with tears in my eyes, to please be kind to me and others

You're assuming that every guy is a lazy, disorganized asshole. Why would you date such a person?

&gt; And yet society pressures people to be in relationships all the time. If a man can't get a relationship, he's a weird creepy incel. If a woman can't get a relationship, she's an 'incomplete hot mess'.

Which part of society does that? I've never heard of it outside of the Internet.

&gt; Even 'good' relationships are power plays (ex. those relationships where the husband is super obtuse about something mean/thoughtless he's doing or he's ignoring his wife's efforts, so the wife does it back or 'goes on strike' to give him a taste of his own medicine, and all of a sudden he's the perfect respectful man after her power play *that she wouldn't have to do in a good relationship).*

No. None of the many, many good relationships in existence are like this. That's a deeply unhealthy relationship. Healthy adults are capable of talking things out.

&gt; * That guy brought his GF flowers just because! *He's totally cheating.*
&gt; * That girl went on a trip with friends and was happy to see her BF when she got back! *She's totally cheating.*
&gt; * That husband cares about his family! *He's a mamma's boy and he'll never put you first whilst also demanding you put him first.*

...who on earth are you talking to? These are absurd.

&gt; he could leave. Or he could die. I could leave or die. Even if we don't leave and we die together

Literally everything is eventually lost. That is not an argument about its value.

No. It is not an unholy amount of work to maintain romance. It can easily be done with several hours a week.

&gt; but doing so is also a sign that we're not really in love because love shouldn't feel like work???? But it also should????

Love taking no work is a stupid meme with no basis in reality, and well-adjusted adults don't think that. *Relationships*, period, take work. Friendships take work.

&gt; Not to mention that the happiest healthiest relationships are apparently 'boring'. Hear that, guys and gals? Apparently exciting relationships are exciting because they're toxic and sad! 

No. This is nonsense. Happy, healthy relationships can and should be exciting.

You're right. Love is an effortless feeling. It's simply wanting to be around the person all the time because it makes you feel good.

Of course. But no one does anything only because it's permanent. You don't avoid cooking a nice meal because it will be gone after you eat it. You don't avoid traveling because eventually you will have to return. So what does this matter?

&gt;Even if we don't leave and we die together, we have to put in UNHOLY amounts of work to stay together and not have the love fade

Again, it seems you have only ever had very sad and negative experiences with relationships. Of course it's awful and exhausting if you assume ahead of time that it will be awful and exhausting. The counterpoint is it very often *isn't* exhausting. In any case, if you are putting in ""UNHOLY"" amounts of work to stay together, then I wouldn't call that love, or a relationship worth keeping.

Meet someone, go on a date or two and then sleep with them because you find them attractive or think they're great, wake up in the morning and go ""Whelp, guess we're together now!"", only to realize that they aren't what you thought they were or wanted them to be?

Not that there's anything wrong with that, but that's not going to get you quality relationships.

And then there is the old adage of ""What is the one thing all of these relationships have in common? You."" You do seem kind of controlling.. chore charts? Passive-aggressive mind games? You feel the need to put effort into inspiring them, instead of just being genuinely inspiring to them? Either you're really controlling, or you're trying to take physically attractive guys who aren't super-invested in you and turn them into both physically *and* emotionally attractive guys.

Relationships don't require an UNHOLY amount of work to stay together, but they do require some compromise, which it seems you're unwilling to do. Not that you have to, but if you're unwilling to compromise your ideals, then why would you expect your partner to be willing to compromise theirs?

""Find someone who is flawed"".... that's a horrible idea. That's a project, not a relationship. That's you trying to cultivate and groom your ideal mate rather than just finding someone who you connect with and are happy being with. If you find someone so flawed that you need to change them, and you keep that to yourself and try to manipulate them into changing, that's a recipe for disaster and you're setting yourself up for failure.

And happy relationships aren't boring, they just don't have excessive conflict or barriers to happiness. They aren't the Hollywood/Pop-Culture romance stories where people get together against impossible odds, or where they start off hating each other only to realize they were meant to be.

It is often violent, exploitive and a lot of porn on PH is straight up rape disguised as ""noncon kink play"", or something of the sort.

Highland park:  In April 2019, local police had gone to the family home after receiving a report Crimo had tried to take his own life using a machete a week prior, according to a police report of the well-being check visit.

Officers spoke with him, and his parents and were told mental health professionals were handling the matter, the report shows.

Then, in September 2019, Highland Park Police went to Crimo's home after a family member reported that he had said he was going to kill everyone, according to another police report.

""The threat was directed at family inside of the home,"" Covelli noted.

Police confiscated a collection of bladed items -- 16 knives, a dagger and a ""Samurai type blade"" that were in Crimo's closet. Later that afternoon, the father went to the police station and picked up the collection and told authorities it belonged to him, according to the police report.

No arrests were made during that incident because there were no signed complaints against Crimo. At the time, involuntary commitment wasn't an option, Covelli said.

Local police submitted a ""Clear and Present Danger"" report about the visit to the Illinois State Police, the police report shows. State police said in that report Crimo had said he didn't intend on harming himself or others when police questioned him at the time.

In a news release, Illinois State Police officials said Crimo in December 2019 applied for a FOID card that was sponsored by his father.

""The subject was under 21 (he was 19) and the application was sponsored by the subject's father. Therefore, at the time of FOID application review in January of 2020, there was insufficient basis to establish a clear and present danger and deny the FOID application,"" state police said.



Buffalo:  Nearly a year before he was charged with shooting and killing 10 shoppers, and wounding three more, at a Buffalo, New York, grocery store, a then-17-year-old student reportedly told his classmates at Susquehanna Valley High School that he “wanted to do a shooting, either at a graduation ceremony, or sometime after.”

He also reportedly mentioned that he wanted to do a murder-suicide at the school, which is located in Broome County in New York.

A teacher reported the comment – made online – to a school resource officer. Since the perpetrator had been at home when he made the comment, it triggered a visit from state police, as opposed to the school resource officer, according to an official account of the episode published in the wake of the shooting in The Buffalo News.

“The State Police visited the home, talked to the student and persuaded him to undergo a mental health evaluation at Binghamton General Hospital,” the article states. “When a doctor evaluated (the perpetrator) as not dangerous – a key hurdle required in the Mental Hygiene Law to hold someone against their will – he was returned home and allowed to graduate days later.”

igul4za,poprostumort,"&gt;33% of agriculture is used to feed livestock. 

Many of of which will be on lower class fields that cannot support growing crops that would be suitable for human consumption. Animal feed comes in a large part from crops that are not edible for us.

---

You cannot just arbitrarily disconnect one from other. If people won't eat meat then they need to eat other produce which will mean that this 33% of farmland would be mostly left away and we would need to convert better class of land to agriculture. Where do you think we can find good class land? Places that are already used for natural habitation would need to be sacrificed to grow crops.

---

&gt;It takes 10 times the grain to make a pound of meat as it takes to make a pound of grain.

No. At worst (assuming feedlot operations in US-style intensive factory farming) it takes \~7kg of grain to produce 1kg of beef, \~4kg of grain for 1kg of pork, and \~2kg of grains for poultry/fish.

But outside US you don't find that much intensive factory farms using feedlot. Most of livestock diet consists of haylage, baelage and silage, which is made from crops that can be grown pretty mych on any ground and is not edible for humans.

So global average would be closer to \~4kg of grain for beef, \~3kg for pork (most of pork feed would be corn silage) and \~2kg still for pollutry/fish (as intensive fish farms are consistently used throughout the globe).

&gt;The farmland being used to feed livestock is not 1/10 as productive as the farmland being used to feed people.

That is not how farmland class works. Low class soils need sufficient nutrients added to produce usable harvest, as you cannot just use them for haylage/baelage/silage. So you will need to ramp up production of fertilizers - which means more energy-intensive production of nitrogen fertilizers, more strip mining for phosphate and potassium fertilizer production. Add to that the fact that you will not have any organic fertilizers as no cattle means no manure.

&gt;People have done the math on this.

Yep, you can do really great math and arrive at results that are at the same time perfectly calculated and completely wrong - all because of omissions and assumptions in preparing data for this impressive math.

You can link me to papers that ""done math on this"" and read them again to see that things like f.ex.:  
\- differentiation of available soil classes  
\- changes in need for fertilizers  
\- comparison of yield of feed to yield of feedable grains  
\- how substitutes of byproducts from meat production would affect environment  
are not included in calculations. All because actually calculating things like that would be an interdisciplinary study that would need specialists from several different fields and huge amount of data from different countries (all standardized to suit global calculations).

&gt;Meat is much worse than the environment

Truth is that we likely cannot fully switch to plant-based diet and reach net-benefit for environment due to all that I have been talking about above (not to mention issues that would it mean on coutnry-scale for many of countries).

Best environmental option that is certain would be to go away with intensive factory farming of cattle as it is the most enviromental-impacting meat production. Missing proteins can be brought from better options (seafood has feed conversion ratio of 1.1 f.ex.). Cattle still could be raised using lower class soils for grazing and production of fermented feed.

But to be honest all that discussion forgets about one major thing - we are not living on unified earth that would allow for most efficient use of land. We live in a world where countries have to do with what they have, and for many counties forgoing meat production would mean being forced to rely on imports and be at risk of starvation when things go south.",2022-07-19 12:59:03,2022-07-19 16:51:17

Using [this pbs page](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/content/two-spirits_map-html/) as a source:

To pull from some native american tribes:

An example of 4 genders (man, women, trans man, trans woman)

&gt;The creation myth of the Mohave tribe speaks to a time when humans were not sexually or gender-differentiated. They recognize four genders: men, women, hwame (male-identified females) and alyha (female-identified males).


An example of males accepted as women:

&gt;The Navajo term nadleehi refers to that culture's traditional third gender, in which a biologically male-born person embodies both the masculine and feminine spirit. Dilbaa refers to a female-born person with a more masculine spirit. Both are considered to encompass both genders in one person.

An example of females accepted as men:

&gt;The ninauposkitzipxpe were honored as a third gender in the North Peigan tribe of the Blackfoot Confederacy in northern Montana and Southern Alberta, Canada. Roughly translated, it means ""manly-hearted woman (http://www.jstor.org/pss/662950),"" and defined a biological female who did not necessarily dress in a masculine mode, but was unrestricted by the social constraints placed on other women in the Blackfoot society.

From Australia here is an example of transgender people being accepted before colonization:

&gt;In Australia, indigenous transgendered people are known as ""sistergirls"" and ""brotherboys"".  As in some other native cultures, there is evidence that transgender and intersex people were much more accepted in their society before colonization. Now, there are more stigmas attached.  But through an increasing number of support groups specifically aimed at sistergirls and brotherboys, who have their own unique psychological and medical needs, perhaps times will change again. http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2014/10/24/4114304.htm + http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/12/09/watch-meet-australias-indigenous-trans-men-brotherboys

From myanmar males assuming the roles of women:

&gt;A third gender consisting of males assuming the dress and social role of women is known in Burmese slang as acault. Acaults often serve as spirit mediums in the indigenous animistic belief system. While some acault are gay, not all are.

In madigascar, there was also this:

&gt;Among the Sakalavas little boys thought to have a feminine appearance were raised as girls. The Antandroy and Hova called their gender crossers sekrata who, like women, wore their hair long and in decorative knots, inserted silver coins in pierced ears, and wore many bracelets on their arms, wrists and ankles. They considered themselves ""real"" women, totally forgetting they were born males, and through long practice spoke with a woman's voice. Their society thought their efforts to be female natural and believed that they had supernatural protection which punished anyone who attempted to do them harm.

These people weren't just gender non-conforming, and aren't just sexual orientation.  These were treated as either their own gender or the gender they became.",2022-07-20 06:46:32,2022-07-20 08:21:04

igz0psa,Winterstorm8932,"The law already defines personhood on a philosophical basis. There are numerous positions on the issue with scientific merit, including the position that a baby is a person from conception. That is not a religious position. It is a philosophical position that does not require any religious doctrine to justify it. Personhood is a purely philosophical (not religious) concept, not a material thing that can be measured like brain waves or a heartbeat; it is inherently “magical,” to use your word. Some religions take a position on it, and some non-religious people take a position on it that may happen to agree with the belief of one or more of those religions. Some philosophers believe personhood is not attained until months or years into an infant’s life, and the law disregards their position and does not give them the freedom to treat infants as non-persons who can be treated however one wishes.

In short, the law already takes a position on when personhood begins, and it does not give those who take a differing position the freedom to choose to kill those who don’t meet their personal definition. Changing the law to reflect a different age at which one attains personhood is no more religious than the law already is.

---

If philosophy falls under the category of religion, then a lot of laws interfere with the first amendment because they impose one set of philosophical beliefs on everyone. And this was exactly my point. Your view on whether an embryo is a person is philosophical, is it not? So is the view that an infant is not a person until, say, the age of 18 months, or the view that a fetus becomes a person at birth, or the view that an embryo is a person from conception. The law already imposes the philosophical beliefs of some onto those who disagree, and it is impossible for it not to do so.

---

But it’s not a religious position. Even if the people advocating for it happen to be religious, everyone’s philosophical beliefs are formed by their religious beliefs. Plenty of people advocate for policies that provide government aid to the poor because they believe Jesus commanded us to care for the poor.

igz7inf,3xtheredcomet,"&gt; We should not use adult struggles to invalidate the struggles of children

As a general statement, I'd feel hard-pressed to even want to or try to change your view on that. Nobody's struggle is invalid. Suffering, even imagined, is real. Heck, when we look at phobias, it's usually in the vein of, ""this is not a real threat but it feels like a real threat and so I'm in genuine fear and so I genuinely suffer."" Say I go to the pantry to get some doritos, and then all of a sudden I'm paralyzed with claustrophobia. Anyone of rational mind, even the rational part of my own mind, can logically determine that I'm in no danger at all, and yet, I still feel it.

I suppose this might work as a decent segue though. When we look at the ""typical"" childhood, I think it's fair to say that societies and cultures will generally put in an effort to shield children from the ""rawness"" of adulthood and adult consequences. A child that does poorly in grade school may be disciplined in a few ways, may be made to sit in detention, or attend summer school, or held back a grade. Their failures are met with scoldings and lecturings, but also multiple chances to try again and also (hopefully) given additional support. An adult who fails to meet performance metrics at their job may instead be let go, and then will have to suffer the consequences of lack of income, blemish on their work history, potentially increased difficulty in finding new work, or even possibly homelessness. Violent children are sent to juvenile detention; violent adults are sent to prison, etc.

In other words, and it feels kind of overly obvious writing this out, but childhood is often used as the training grounds for adulthood. Childhood consequences from childhood mistakes, in general, are therefore *less* than adult consequences from adult mistakes, not *invalid*, but *less*.

It may then serve as a useful tool, say when a child makes a mistake and feels it's the end of the world, to gently remind them that it's not, that they'll have additional chances to make right and to do better, that they ought to use this opportunity to learn from this mistake and improve, and that it's better they made this kind of mistake now, in childhood, because the same kind of mistake in adulthood has far worse consequences.

---

&amp;#x200B;

Sure. I don't disagree with your overall view in spirit. However, there are some additional considerations that in some cases do justify hesitancy before validating a child's emotions.

First, how children react emotionally is heavily dependent on feedback from their parents and others. If a child falls over, but Mom and Dad don't gasp or look worried, they will often just get up and move on, rather than cry. Children learn from us and others how to emotionally respond to events in their life. If every bump or ""conflict"" (e.g. a puppy doesn't let them pet it; I lost the board game) is validated and taken seriously by the parent, then there's a risk of inculcating attitudes that may leave them unprepared to cope with hardship later on in life.

2. Some struggles also shouldn't be validated. My nephew (age 6) frequently cries or complains after having intentionally hurt his younger sibling. He might break his brother's toy out of jealousy, and insist that it was his brother that wronged him, and then cry to elicit sympathy from Mom or Dad. In such cases, I've seen my sister ( a trained Nanny and primary school teacher) try to get him to evaluate the fairness of what actually happened, and in-so-doing, avoiding giving feedback that would tell him that crying and anger are inappropriate responses to that situation.

Of course my sister knows that their little brains ""feel"" like they have been wronged, but how and if these emotions are validated by parents also impacts how the child may act and feel in future conflicts. So, at those ages, ""you shouldn't feel upset over this"" can be perfectly appropriate in some cases. Obviously, mocking or disregarding a child can be counter-productive, but  it *is* okay to downplay some struggles. It's balancing act that requires assessment of the child's age, agency, the particular conflict, etc.

3. I think your point about stressed, anxious, and depressed children is perfectly valid. A child predisposed to certain symptoms, or a teenager who is contemplating self-harm should be handled differently than ones who aren't. But some emotional struggles in teenagers years are made that much more tragic because of social and parental feedback.

For example:

&gt;for many teenagers, high school means the world to them, most of their interactions with the outside world is there, and to them, grades mean life and death.

I have talked to many teenagers whose self-hatred and negative feelings in high school were exacerbated by the idea--passed on to them by adults--that high school and college are the ""best years of their lives"". They were told that they needed to make the most of their time, and studies, and friendships in school because that is how you set the course for your life.

Adults who later downplay feelings related to high school break-ups or bad grades, or not making the football team, are often also the ones who initially taught their kids to believe that their worth and happiness depends on these types of successes.

If I feel the world is ending because I have to re-take a grade, I probably need a voice that disagrees with these feelings. Obviously their are more or less effective ways of doing so. I agree that the initial feelings shouldn't be dismissed, but they also shouldn't be reinforced, and sometimes the line between these gets blurred.",2022-07-20 14:54:53,2022-07-20 17:18:14
igzo6xq,Grunt08,"A relevant opinion by Meghan McArdle:

&gt;The whole thing quickly became a Rorschach test. Many progressives cheered to see Professor Bridges school a reactionary Republican. But conservatives also cheered, because they see a gift to Republican election campaigns.

&gt;Unlike a Rorschach test, however, this one has a right answer, and the progressives have it wrong. Moreover, the fact that they can’t see just how badly this exchange went for their side shows what a big mistake it was to let academia and media institutions turn into left-wing monocultures.

&gt;Within those rarefied circles, Bridges’s answers were exquisitely and exactly correct. She allowed no hint that late-term fetuses might have moral value, because that might suggest their interests could be weighed against those of the, well, pregnancy-capable. Nor did she concede an inch to the idea that biology can trump gender identity. And when she ran out of patience with Hawley’s questions, she pounced in exactly the prescribed manner: Your questions are transphobic, Senator, and you are putting trans people at risk of violence or suicide by denying their lived reality.

&gt;Yet outside those circles, Bridges’s answers don’t really sound so convincing. In most of America, “Does a late-term fetus have value?” is a softball. And when Hawley leaped in to ask whether women are the ones who give birth — a question few Americans today would struggle with — she resorted to extended question-begging. That might be fine for a Berkeley classroom. But it just won’t do for a political debate in which the [majority](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/06/28/americans-complex-views-on-gender-identity-and-transgender-issues/) of voters [disagree](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-americans-stand-on-abortion-in-5-charts/) with you.

&gt;Anyone who has ever tried to convince anyone of anything should be able to see that Bridges’s approach was counterproductive. Why, then, did so many articles and tweets cheer the way she “SHUT DOWN” Hawley?

&gt;Because there is one place that snickering, eye-rolling and so forth are very effective: within an insular group, where they help delineate the lines of acceptable belief. A sufficiently incredulous “Are you suggesting … ?” effectively signals a silent corollary: “… because if you are, we’ll shun you.” It tells people that this topic is not up for discussion.

Here is the central problem: the trans advocacy movement as it currently exists champions an understanding of gender (and how society should be changed in response to that new understanding) that was conceived in a silo of faculty lounges, classrooms and tumblr.  It put on some of the accoutrements and coopted the arguments of the gay marriage movement (despite their many differences) and made pronunciations with all the moral certitude of gay people demanding equal rights.

The definitions of man and woman are to become tautological, a person is whatever they say they are without caveat or condition, disagreeing with a person's claims concerning their gender is an act of bigotry no matter how it's expressed, and gendered language must be systematically, ruthlessly, and annoyingly reorganized for the sake of inclusion. Saying ""Ellen Page starred in Juno"" is a form of sacrilege because a trans person's old name is bizarrely Voldemortized.  Children who report a vague inclination towards a different set of gender norms may well need to be treated with synthetic hormones and possibly subjected to medical procedures that make them a lifelong patient...that we essentially never did this a few years ago is not grounds for objection.  People in single-sex spaces made uncomfortable by the presence of people who are not of their sex are bigots and their concerns need no validation.  Disagreeing with any of the above is transphobic irrespective of intent, and you will either accept it without objection or be regarded as the spiritual cousin of a racist.

At no point were the vast majority of Americans consulted concerning what they thought of this new understanding of gender (and how society should be changed in response to that new understanding) before elements of the progressive left essentially began demanding that everyone comply without question.  If you do question - or if you have the audacity to disagree - you're called a bigot and hit with the ""suicide card""...which is essentially a way of saying ""do what I say or I'll kill myself.""

This all should have been negotiated in the culture, but it wasn't - so it will be, eventually.

Why is it necessarily the case that we need to radically alter language to proactively include the possibility that transmen can get pregnant?  Is a pregnant transman unaware that he's way, *way* outside the norm? Do we think the infinite delicacy of word choice tricks him into feeling like he's not?

Why don't we have more of a BC/AD-type convention with names instead of turning the sound of an old name into a chosen trauma?

Why does anyone have some inalienable right to ""validation?""  It's not normal for human beings to reflexively validate and agree with any claim a person makes about themselves, so why is it an inflexible truth of trans people?

What are its limitations?  By which I mean: at what points are we *not* going to validate someone's identity because something else is more important?

Perhaps most relevant: why is disagreeing with something that seems false an act of bigotry?  Can any discussion actually happen if any objection to one side is inherently hateful?

EDIT - Maybe this is a better conclusion: if you choose to count this as transphobia, you might as well accept that that accusation is going to be useless in short order because you'll use it to describe so many widely-held, non-malicious views that it won't function as a critique.",2022-07-20 18:02:09,2022-07-20 18:02:09

I believe Josh Hawley is personally transphobic and is party to a transphobic political movement. That said, that ideological thread is not necessarily present in this line of questioning. Let me try to present a charitable reading of his line of questioning is:

&gt;Q1: people with a capacity for pregnancy

He is clarifying terminology.

&gt;Q2: not really a women's rights issue

He is clarifying that if this issue also pertains to men, then it is not really a women's rights issue in the sense that such an issue *only* pertains to women.

&gt;Q3: Wait, are you saying my questions are opening up people to violence?

He is confused at her harsh response, which indicates that, while he almost certainly was fishing for gotchyas, he did not have a clear direction for his questions beyond that. He was being purely reactive. Even this question is only a clarifying question.

&gt;Q4: (interupting her) because of my line of questioning? So we can't talk about it?

Hawley is being defensive because he felt he was only trying to clarify her statements. We could say that he demonstrates poor emotional regulation in how he interrupts her, but such interruptions are not outside the norm for these hearings (especially from Republicans).

&gt;Q5: I'm denying that trans people exist by asking you if we are talking about women's . . . having pregnancies?

It seems like he was actually confused.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Law Prof: Do you think men can get pregnant?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hawley: No
&gt;
&gt;Law Prof: that is denying that trans men exist

Even here, Hawley seems confused and overwhelmed, not ready for the reversal of aggro GOP questioning tactics being thrown back on him. While his statement is a denial of the existence of trans men, he is functionally a lay person on the subject, he is reacting, and it's not clear that it was motivated by transphobia, even if he is transphobic (which he probably definitely is)

&gt;Q6: and that leads to violence? Is this how you run your classroom?

He's trying to deflect, because she got him, she looks clever and strong and he looks stupid and weak. He is trying to regain control.

**TL;DR:** Even if Hawley is a transphove (which he probably is), this whole line of questioning can be read as him fishing for gotchas and losing control of the conversation, completely unmotivated by transphobia.

ih0941t,EmpyreanMiquella,"Your statistics are skewed and not just because of what someone else mentioned earlier.

The 3.7% applies to worldwide, not per country. So no you wouldn't take the percentage, 3.7% and multiply it to get America's estimate of fraud per born children because that percentage is including all participating countries. 

And the discrepancy world wide ranges between 0.8% to as high as 30%.

2 out of 50 British men were raising children who weren't their own in 2021.

And the 30% range for paternity fraud came from a 1999 report from the AABB (American Association of Blood Banks). 

Lastly, it's important to note the discrepancy range of 0.8% to 30% because the paternity fraud issue isn't as big as you think, nor is it as easily recorded for statistical use. Not every child is DNA tested, a lot of the time there is no reason to question the identity of the child. Most women already do not put a name on the certificate if they do not know the father, and even if they put a name, the father has to actually SIGN in order to be liable for child support and have custodial, visitation rights when that happens. 

When fraud occurs, there are already laws in place to handle that issue if found out.

Secondly you can not put extreme punishments in place without being able to prove something was legitimate fraud. 

1.) If the woman knows this wasn't his kid, and leads him to believe it's his, this is fraud.

2.) If the man isn't sure it's his kid and signs before getting a test, this isn't fraud, this is on him. You don't sign first big decisions like purchasing homes, a car, or claiming parental rights over a child if your basis for that is that YOU ARE HAVING DOUBTS. 

3.) If the woman can not remember who the father is because the couple had dealt with a now resolved issue of cheating almost a year ago, it's not fraud to put her husband down, and once again if he agrees and it turns out the kid is not his, this wasn't fraud. He wasn't purposely misled and in this case, he was aware of a previous incident they worked through together.

For something to be fraud, you have to prove ill-intent. Setting up vague laws like this where putting a man's name down doesn't make him legally obligated until he signs, is wrong and also opens the doorway further for people to abuse it. A man could know the woman he slept with has multiple partners, agree to sign the sheet, and then claim he was misled into believe the kid was his when the DNA test comes back negative. Then boom, now the woman is a felon, going to get 10 years of jail time, according to the punishment you believe it should get. The child is going to have no mother or father. 

There's already punishments in place for fraud, including reimbursements for child support, emotional damage, etc. That is assuming, it can be proven too, and that's important. Punishments aren't for the vague, that sets the precedence for a system of abuse.",2022-07-20 20:47:28,2022-07-20 20:47:28

As for relationship between WFH and gaming, I would rather say that WFH was a good thing for gaming. Most people aren't robots that are productive through the whole workday, so usually some time was ""wasted"" at little breaks to go get coffee, small talk with co-workers and many other things that allowed to take a break from actual work.

But with WFH you can take a break without sneaking around. And for many people this means to play a game for a while.

Most popular NFTs right now are scams but there are actually very cool usecases.

for example concert tickets as NFTs.

* you know its a real one if you buy from the official collection
* you know that it cant be used twice (seller can't sell it to you and then use it themselves).
* concert promoters can get royalties on secondary sales (if you can't go and sell it to someone else, concert promoter can earn some %share of it) -&gt; they could use that profit to partially refund all ticket purchases (make them cheaper).
* there is a liquid market for the tickets of all the ppl that changed their mind/can't attend and want to sell their ticket. so you have always an overview of the cheapest ticket available.
* after the concert, all NFTs that have been scanned at the entrance could transform into an after movie and would serve as a cool memory. non-scanned NFTs could turn blank.

Edit: Why the downvotes? In the context of the CMV, this is a completely valid use case, if you are going to down vote then state where I am wrong!

*I want someone to convince me that NFT's are something not as nefarious as I make it out to be, perhaps I have my fact wrong and that there is some legitimate usage for NFT's at least down the pipeline*

I never said that they were BETTER than a digital ticketing system, or that they should be adopted, just that there can be legitimate use cases for NFTs and that this is one... 

Breaking ticketmaster's hold on event ticket sales is a legitimate option that NFTs COULD be used for, not that it's the BEST way or the ONLY way, just that it is a viable option.

People complain, but not here in CMV. Here it's almost only about PoC --&gt; White.

&gt;  If, for example, a child looks different, that's their main way to question fatherhood

Ok? This doesn't make someone Black or White though, it just makes the baby 'different.' Also, this difference doesn't always have to be different races, this kind of thing can be shown with eye-color (for example) or a number of other features.

&gt; this character that completely doesn't look how their supposed to

""Supposed to"" is a bit odd here. It's a fake person, therefore malleable. The only way a race-swap would matter (if the plot isn't racial) would be if you think about how White the characters are throughout the book, which seems odd to me. Also, what someone looks like in a book is rarely what they look like on screen: why are there only complaints when this specific feature (skin color) is changed?

&gt; It breaks with the moviemaking idea of ""show don't tell""

Actually, your scene here with the baby being a different color is 100% show-don't-tell. The thing is, neither race is specified beyond ""they look different"" (which may not even be racial). Nothing tells us which race the two should be.

Also, this isn't what I meant when I said ""metaphor"" because this isn't a metaphor. What I meant was something like [MIA's music video for Born Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeMvUlxXyz8&amp;t=383s) where race-swapping is part of the message.

There is no 'message' in what you're complaining about and that, to me, is the biggest difference. The race-swapping you're complaining about is meaningless, imo, and, therefore, fine, like MacBeth being played by Denzel.

ih247k8,keepitclassybv,"One of my friends made a convincing argument about the US system to me and I'll repeat it here as best I can. 

The US system is great for ""around the house"" and ""agricultural"" use where tolerances are very wide. 

For example, if you're gardening and you need to plant a seed half an inch, you can just go up to the top of your fingernail on your thumb as the correct distance. Halfway up the fingernail for a quarter inch. Up to the first knuckle for an inch. 

If you're planting bushes or trees, 12 feet of space is really easy to estimate using your foot. Pacing off a 100 yard field for a game of American football is easy as well, if you're measuring bigger distances. 

All of these measures aren't going to be exact, but it is ""good enough""...a tree won't care if it's 13ft or 11ft apart... close enough to 12. A football game between kids still works if it's in an 84 or 116 yard field. A seed still sprouts if it's 0.3 inches instead of 0.25 inches. 

So people still use it because it's very convenient in situations where tolerance isn't critical. 

It's much easier to plant a tree 12 ""feet"" apart than to estimate 3.2 meters. You can plant a whole row and it will look uniform as each space can be consistently 12 of your feet. It will look *better* than if you try to eyeball the distance in metric, you'll get an irregular looking row.

You might argue that it's trivial to just use a tape measure, but it's really not. The hassle just isn't worth it.

---

Those are 2. The US system makes it far easier to measure in between those sizes. 

I can uniformly estimate from an 1/8th inch up to 6 inches using just my hands. I can estimate uniformly with feet from that point on. 

A pace isn't uniform, you can't uniformly mark off 3.3 paces 100 times. You *can* mark off 4 ""feet"" uniformly 100 times... or any of the other measurements I mentioned. 

You *could* uniformly mark off 3.3m by converting to cm first... but you'd need to lay down your fingernail 330 times to do it once.

ih2fn94,TuskaTheDaemonKilla,"When people argue that a pay gap exists, they are arguing that there are social and structural factors that cause women to be paid less in the long-term because they are less likely to get raises, more likely to have their career suffer from maternity leave, or they are being driven into lower paying careers. In simple terms, women's choices are largely responsible for the pay gap sure, but those choices are primarily influenced by sexist aspects of society.

One tangible example of this kind of phenomenon is the way teachers emphasize certain academics for boys and not for girls. In [this 2002 study](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20909/w20909.pdf), a group of Israeli researchers followed three classes of students from grade 3 to 6. They periodically had their math tests graded by either teachers who knew the kids or 3rd parties who did not know them. The teachers who knew the students gave the boys better grades. The 3rd parties gave the girls better grades. The tests were the same. The researchers concluded that the teachers who knew the kids had an unconscious bias in favor of the boys. They speculated that the same phenomenon happens in the children's homes too. The long-term effect is that boys are encouraged by their successes in STEM precursor classes such as math and sciences whereas girls are discouraged because they see themselves doing the same, if not better, work as the boys but getting worse results and less encouragement. Consequently, as they get older they become less interested in these subjects, and that's one of the major reasons why we have a lack of women in STEM. This is just one area where this occurs. The same phenomenon can be replicated in sports, toys, relationships, etc.

That being said, I'm going to go further and argue men and women are not even paid the same for the same work. [We have studies that show that when women enter a workforce the wages for everyone in that workforce decrease. By contrast, when men enter a workforce, the wages increase.](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/88/2/865/2235342) A simple example can be found in the field of recreation — working in parks or leading camps — which went from predominantly male to female from 1950 to 2000. Median hourly wages in this field declined 57 percentage points, after accounting for the change in the value of the dollar. Similarly, the job of ticket agent also went from mainly male to female during this period, and wages dropped 43 percentage points. The same thing happened when women in large numbers became designers (wages fell 34 percentage points), housekeepers (wages fell 21 percentage points) and biologists (wages fell 18 percentage points). The reverse was true when a job attracted more men. Computer programming, for instance, used to be a job done primarily by women. But when male programmers began to outnumber female ones, the job gained prestige and wages increased even before the complexity of the work increased.

We also have [Bureau of Labour Statistics data](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat39.htm) which shows that women working basically the same job as men get paid less than them. Notably, the median earnings of information technology managers (mostly men) are 27 percent higher than human resources managers (mostly women). At the other end of the wage spectrum, janitors (usually men) earn 22 percent more than maids and housecleaners (usually women). This is despite the fact that these jobs require essentially the same skills/education.

There have also been studies indicating that when you account for all the other factors that might influence the wage gap, primarily pregnancy, you still find that women are paid less (around 94%) than their male counterparts in the exact same job, at the same level, and with the same productivity.",2022-07-21 09:14:18,2022-07-21 09:14:18

ih2q7ju,zeratul98,"Okay, let me try to explain ways in which these things could be discriminatory practices and you can decide which seem plausible to you

&gt;So basically my view is that women are more likely to want to have time off to be with the family which leads to less total pay

Or perhaps they simply have to in heterosexual relationships. Think about this, maternity leave is common in the US, paternity leave is rare. This is a signal of expectations: that women take care of kids and men work. So if a man and a woman both try to reduce hours to take care of their families, who is more likely to receive a positive response. If a man and a woman are both up for promotions, both being young, married, and currently childless, who is more likely to get it? The women who is expected to eventually quit her career to raise her kids or the man who's expected to keep working? Men and women make different choices, but they make those choices within different expectations of how they will be treated 

&gt;My last point is the difference in negotiation skills between men and women which leads to differences in pay for the exact same tasks. “57% of male Carnegie Mellon graduate business students negotiate their starting salaries. However, only 7% of women negotiate salaries… men’s starting salaries… are 7.6% higher than women’s.” source It seems that women are (or at least used to be) worse at negotiation and lost some potential salary this way as well. 

Right, but ask them why? The answer i most often hear is ""i don't want to seem pushy/bossy/naggy."" Do women not negotiate salaries because they don't want more money? No. More likely, they're worried pushing for more money will be fruitless and be perceived negatively.

&gt;So, I hope this post doesn’t offend anyone. I’m completely open to new perspectives. It just doesn’t seem to be a “systemic” problem like the news would have you believe and seems to have more to do with our own personal culture of motherhood 

Culture doesn't come from nowhere though. It's a set of expectations and norms put on people. If two people want the same thing, but one will be socially punished for striving for it, than it's not just ""individual preferences"". It's cultural coercion

---

&gt;Well maternity leave is more of a norm because women have to have time off to have the child

Maternity leaves frequently last for months after giving birth, longer than is necessary to physically recover. The point of that extra time is to give mothers time with their new children.

&gt;Once again, the perception of negotiation is more of a difference between perceptions of men and woman and not of an actual discriminatory practice.

Perception of what? It seems like it's an expectation of how their employer will respond. Either that's a rational expectation, which would mean that yes, this is an example of systemic discrimination, or you think it's irrational and baseless, so then you'd have to explain why people hold this expectation.


&gt;I would need some research to show that employers would rather give raises to men than woman rather than just a general statement.

While a company may be a distinct entity from other companies, its parts are decidedly not. The owner(s) and/or employees that make up a company may also work for other companies at the same time. Furthermore, this overlap can be 100%. If Bob and Sue are the only workers at Company A which markets widgets, and also the only workers at Company B which provides accounting services, then how do we approach this? Can we have two different organisms that share the same body and mind? This is akin to arguing that a person with Dissociative Identity Disorder is, in fact, more than one organism.

---

&gt;first, we'd have to establish a reason to believe that singular identity is necessarily singular to a unique biological entity, but again here i wonder about turtles all the way down.

I’ll be honest, I am not sure what this sentence means. I was pointing out that the goals and actions of an organism are not what distinguish it from other similar organisms, no matter how different those goals or actions are. I do not become a different organism if I change my name, or switch careers, or decide to never eat pizza again, or undergo gender-reassignment surgery. I might call myself a “new person” metaphorically, but I am still the same unique human. In fact, there is nothing I can do that would ever result in me becoming a different organism.

Entity, the term you’ve used in much of your reply and I used once in mine, is a much broader term. Entities need to be distinct from each other, but they do not have any physical requirements. Entities can be entirely conceptual. They do not need to be contiguous. Companies are entities. But they don’t meet the requirements to be classified as an organism.

Then your next example is one that is ""we don't need to use measurement at all"", whichbis fine, but is not another sytem  than metric....its a non system.  E.g. you could propose a formal system, but grandma wouldn't fit that, or ONLY grandma would fit in it, making it not really a system.

Your argument seems to be different that your statement which is that there are times when formal systems aren't as useful as general language.

---

You're still comparing systems with non-sytems.  E.g. there are times we don't need a formal system.

For your measurement example you're describing why switching is hard, not why one system is better than another.  It'd Stull be better if only one system were used....that would mean. No need for conversion to use recipes from other locations.  Further in a cooking example most ""real"" cooking recipes and practices are based on weight and conversion to volume SUCKs in imperial.  So...metric can make that easy for not having a cooking scale.  The imperial solution in kitchens a conversion chart.

---

If you work in a kitchen you only remember a single conversion number and you're set, and the math is easy.  Conversion is way easier, you memorize dry weight conversion units.  It's 10x more stuff to know to do it for imperial, which is why the charts are everywhere.

Youbdont have a single cup that is a cup though.  Or tablespoons.  When you're using actual imperial cups you're using measuring cups.  When you're using grandma's recipe you're using objects.  It's not like those objects don't exist in metric kitchens and it's not like you're gonna get your bread recipe to work out if it imperial and you use your coffee cup to measure.  There's zero advantage here because both grandma and recipes have need for measuring devices and casual objects.  Giving just casual objects is not useful just because the words sound the same between grandma and imperial measures.  And...given you need both metric has conversion built in for all wet and a simple handful of factors for dry.

---

Well...it was required memorization, and you'd only do it for commons.  But...a hell of a lot easier.


Even if you drop that, you're just ignoring the  rest which leaves zero benefit for imperial in the kitchen.  Cups aren't cup sized, so either you've got grandmas non precise stuff which isn't imperial or metric, or you've got measuring cups, spoons and scales.  Thisbeasily favors unifying knowledge around one system as its still you only arguing that sometimes you don't need a system.

Essentially no one in all of America has a ""teacup"".  And finding ""1/2"" withing the queens teacup is fraught with problems.  Plus....more homes have measuring cups than homes have teacups that are approximately a cup.  Don't get me going on the spoons.

---

Yeah.  That's the point.  You've got measuring cups so make them metric.  It's a switching problem, not a better or worse system.  We have to. Relate two of every recipe, localize products and recipe, convert imported products, etc.  You're not making ""specific task easier"" here you're continuing uneeded complexity.

---

Huh?  I'm arguing for never converting to metric because you're using metric.  (i'm not sure I fully got your post here though, cuz that last sentence lost some words I think).

You're arguing to have both metric and imperial.  I'm saying you have one set of recipes, one set of cups/spoons, etc.  There is nothing gained by adding a second in this case.  It's not making tasks easier, it's making them harder and making a world need to conform to their existence harder as well.

---

The ML is the most common small divisor within the metric liter, but it's not like it's the only one.  Not sure what your point is there.  While I grew up using imperial, it's been 20 years or so since I've not used it.  At no point have I thought it would be more or less convenient to use the imperial system.  I've never once used a teaspoon to doll out a cup of something, have you?  Similarly, i've never used my 5ml to doll out a 1/2 liter or a liter or a 50ml.  Perhaps they are confusing to you, but i'd suggest thats just lack of familiarity talking.  The ratios to other are more simple if anything, but..certainly not less.

But many are also just assholes too, also to varying degrees. ""Some people on the internet are mean"" isn't a super bold thesis :)

Like, do we expect people to publicly rush to his defense in order to keep their anti body shaming cred? I think where maybe you have an expectation of people ""being displeased"", it's more likely that those people are just indifferent in this situation. Elon Musk is one of the richest and most powerful people on the planet, and he's already joking about the picture on Twitter. He's fine. I think there's plenty of room for people to be anti body shaming while simultaneously just giving zero shits about this.

ih4eu58,masterzora,"&gt; the MCU doesn’t seem to have that much character development for Tony Stark. We don’t see him suffer the consequences of his actions for the most part

Character development and consequences are two totally different things that are only sometimes related. Consequences *can* be the key impetus for a character growing or changing, but it's just as possible to have other (or, in rare cases, *no*) reasons. Moreover, even when consequences are involved in character development, it doesn't mean every sin and vice needs an individual consequence.

For all the problems MCU has, Tony still develops quite a lot from Iron Man to Endgame. Some characters develop to the point where it would be hard to see how their first appearance and last appearance are even the same person if you missed all the bits in between. That's definitely not the case with Tony. He very much comes across as someone who has grown up and put in the work and was still continuing to do so daily rather than somebody who fixed all of his faults or completely changed who they were.

Though, I will say, that bit with the reporter wasn't *strictly* necessary. Plenty of works demonstrate perfectly well that somebody is a womanizer without relying on scenes like that. But that still doesn't really make it fanservice, either, unless we're pretty much defining any attractive person showing a bit of skin to be fanservice.

ih55mhq,Tnspieler1012,"&gt;no one who is not either rich or already a part of an established party group can win which inevitably leads to a government which does not represent its constituents outside of a select few.

On wealth, the two richest candidates in the Democratic primary, Bloomberg and Steyer, were among the least popular. So while personal money obviously helps, it's influence can be exaggerated. Even Trump's initial success had very little to do with his personal wealth than maybe his celebrity status and the perception by his base that he was a savvy, wealthy businessman. 

Regarding being ""part of an established party group"". Why is this problematic or undemocratic? Of course people will have more confidence in a candidate that aligns with the party they trust. Party membership and identification communicates to voters the platform and general direction that the candidate wants the country to go based on the values and past behavior of other representatives of the same party. Even if voters aren't particularly enthusiastic about the individual, a vote for that person is still a vote for the party they identify with, and thus it is  less risky than voting independent.

Nothing about political party affiliation entails that they only represent the few. They are ultimately only as powerful as the support they receive from the electorate, and a Democratic party senator has the same pressures to be accountable to his or her constituents as an independent.

---

I don't doubt that their remain disparities among the demographics of representatives and the population more broadly. However, it seems as though much of that is most often the product of broader historic forces and voter preferences, and that this is also visibly changing.

You're simply be more likely to get off the ground as a national politician if you are well-connected, well-educated, have free time and disposable income. I don't imagine there are many systems where this wouldn't be true.

Moreover, The median age of the Senate is 64.3 years, so considering the race and gender advantages of being white, male, and wealthy in the mid-late 20th century, and the higher participation rates of older voters in modern elections, then it shouldn't be surprising that the legislature is as it currently is.

That said, I don't know that this results in an ""inability"" to represent the American people, since these candidates owe their position to the consent of the governed and will be evaluated on how responsive they are to their policy interests. If the candidate votes against their community's interests then they can be voted out. And, If the electorate doesn't feel represented (if a candidate comes off as ""elite"" and detached from their constituents), then they will likely struggle to develop a rapport with voters. 

In the Trump, post-Trump era in particular there's been a clear move to support ""outsider"" candidates opposed to the wealthy, educated elite. 8 of the incoming 2020 congress members didn't have a 4-year degrees, reflecting an appetite for a different type of representative \[perceived to be \]more in line with the constituents of some states.

Gender is not a social construct, it is a complex biochemical phenomena. You could have an individual with [GD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria) with no attachment to society or norms, and perhaps not even language—and they would still benefit from gender affirming hormone replacement. Gender is exceedingly messy and is determined by a number of neurochemical phenomena, with [structural differences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8604863/) being evident in the brain before any kind of treatment. These differences do not depend on any culture or societal customs. GD just hurts, in the same way that depression just hurts. These are real issues with real solutions, with massive bodies of evidence supported by the entirety of the medical community. It as close as objective as you can get for the purposes of human health.

*Gender roles* are a social construct, and do depend on the society in question. An important clarification that needs to be understood.

Lobbying is often *necessary* for any interested group. If a Congressperson is about to do something dumb, say he wants to give public funding for a Bigfoot Museum or build a 1:1 scale copy of the pyramids of Giza, and you schedule a meeting to explain what a *bad idea* that is then you have lobbied them.

ih68smv,Slinkusmalinkus,"Firstly, the US Federal Government has a legislative body called Congress, which is bicameral, meaning it has two parts: the House and the Senate.

The House members are intended to be representatives of the enfranchised population (whoever is allowed to vote).

The Senate members are intended to be representatives of their states (and, historically, representatives of their state governments).

The President is the head of the executive branch and seems now to be supposed to represent the will of the people as a whole, based on how elections are conducted nationally.

That aside, all those checks and balances that America loves are actually systematized ways through which the will of the people is stymied: the electoral college, the Senate, the Supreme Court.

To your point, it is less a matter of spending and more a matter of the socioeconomic status of members of Congress (House and Senate). This more applies to the Senate, but is also true for leadership in the House: members of Congress are kinda rich. Pelosi (House - D - Party Leadership) and McConnel (Senate - R - Party Leadership) are fabulously wealthy. Yes, of course they are lobbied and all that, but even if they weren't, how're these deca/centimillionaire political elite going to empathize and understand the troubles and desires of the common person?

I work for a medical device company (ultrasound). We’ve used machine learning to guide patients in using our device on their own (without the assistance of a doctor) accurately and safely. Before machine learning guidance, this wasn’t safe or accurate, so it was not allowed by the fda. The company is lobbying to get that changed, so that patients don’t have to unnecessarily visit doctors. This is especially useful in the covid era when visiting a hospital can spread disease. So while my company is technically lobbying, it’s not really corruption, it’s arguing for a better law.

ih7h9ja,Full-Professional246,"I think you need to separate out this view a bit.

There are originals and there are copies. These can be digital or real world or some combination.

In the 'paper' category, having an original vs a xerox copy. Generally speaking, originals allow for a much greater examination of the signature and the ability to have seals/stamps or other physical security devices not appearing in a copy. If you want evidence, the original is the version you want as it provides more opportunities to validate it is authenticity.

Moving to digital. There are mechanisms of digital signing to explicitly protect against changes. If you utilize this technology, you are creating numerous 'originals' to distribute. They aren't really 'copies'. A copy is a version of the document/file without said protections against change. Again, just like the paper side, if you want or need to verify authenticity, the 'original' is what you want. 

When you mix the formats, its gets more complicated. A scan of a wet signed form doesn't include all of the authentication capabilities of the original. It can though, include signatures and records of reception of this original document in its file and through those change protections. It can be almost as good because you have the file, as the authority holding the original claims it appears - with protections against changes. 

If your standard is merely a signature, then you likely are right. In this day an age, that is not much protection. (I kinda want to make an automatic signing machine now). But, when you include signatures with other tools such as a notary and registration of the document, you get more security. 

And to the point of your CMV, there is actually more to this than simple Original vs Copy. Sometimes a 'Copy' has more authenticity protections than an 'Original'. We should strive to use means and methods appropriately for documents and move beyond the simplistic copy vs original.",2022-07-22 09:28:02,2022-07-22 09:28:02
ih7n666,Tullyswimmer,"Hi, your friendly digital forensics guy here:

There is a very important reason to worry about ""originals"" and ""copies"" in the digital world, because *when* and *who* created those things can be extremely important for civil, and especially criminal, cases.

Let's say that someone has their computer seized and a digital forensic search completed because of a suspicion of money laundering or some other financial crime, embezzlement, or something. If the documents and files on their computer weren't created by ""them"" (being, the person who had access to the account that created or modified the file) then the level to which they can be prosecuted is drastically less than if they're the originator of the documents. 

Another example is cases that I've read about where someone was accused of possessing CSAM, or other types of illegal digital content. If the person being accused can prove that they don't have access to the account that created the file, then they didn't break any laws, and the investigation will be about the person or people who have access to the accounts that created the file. 

Moving to a civil case, if there's an accusation of IP theft, the companies involved must be able to prove the origin of the file, including who may have modified it and when the first revision was created, things like that. 

So, while in a legal sense, the ""wet signature"" thing is probably no longer particularly useful in the era of docusign or other things, there's absolutely good reason to keep track of ""original"" and ""copy"" versions of digital documents.",2022-07-22 10:05:37,2022-07-22 10:05:37
ih7o28u,AITAthrowaway1mil,"In the spirit of good faith argument, I’ll engage now that you’ve clarified what you meant by social security. (I’m sure you’ve figured this out by now, but social security in America is specifically for people who have retired after paying into it their whole lives or people who are disabled). 

What you’re saying sounds great on paper, but in practice you’d run into some nasty problems. I can’t speak to Germany, but in America, it’s notoriously difficult to prove you’re too disabled to work. I have a friend whose a lawyer that specializes in these cases, and she had to go through three appeals to get the government to acknowledge that her triple amputee client was too disabled to work. And even then, that client has to go back to the government every few years to apply for disability again, just in case he grows back those three limbs. 

So effectively what you’d end up with is a lot of people who shouldn’t be working forced to work with vulnerable populations or understaffed organizations. Imagine someone who lost their job due to a violently explosive temper caused by multiple concussions spending their time hauling groceries for the elderly. Imagine someone without the money to cover their psychiatric medication behaving erratically at a charity they’re working for, and diverting resources from that charity because now the workers need to focus on calming them down or going through the process of telling the government that this person isn’t suited for the position.

&gt;LOL at North Dakota listed as white. 

The map has North Dakota listed as a state that does not implement online voter registration. This is technically correct because you can't have online voter registration if you don't have voter registration. 

&gt;It is impossible to turn ND orange without reducing voting access.

In North Dakota, in order to vote (ignoring absentee voting, etc), you need to show up to the polling place, show your Photo ID, show your proof of residence (if different from ID), and fill out and return the ballot they give you. That's it. You have successfully voted, no extra steps to worry about.

If ND changed its laws to allow you to register online, that would necessarily introduce additional steps that would make it harder to vote, thus reducing voting access.

&gt;This is a classic example of manipulating statistics to mislead and deceive people. 

They are using the fact that North Dakota technically does not have online voter registration to falsely imply that North Dakota is restricting voting access when the truth is the opposite.

Because if you're claiming it's just because we got a crop of bad party leaders... no, that's not it. The voters who elected those leaders were *already* demonizing the other side.

Truth is, I think the entire problem is structural. It's all because we have an electoral system where winning 50.1% of the vote means you get the job and winning 49.9% of the vote means you get nothing.

That *demands* a two-party system, because if voters don't vote in solidary against the most powerful thing that they dislike, that thing wins.

And getting people to vote in solidary against the most powerful thing that they dislike requires us to demonize the opposition.

Most adult religious people eventually answer that question by simply choosing to live consistently with a belief that god exists and no longer questioning how the universe works. In a life consistent with god's existence, people affirm god's existence--and that's the belief religious people talk about.

In this way, for many people, belief in god *is* a choice.

You consciously chose not to reject the arguments against religion and instead to legitimately consider them. That attitude was a choice.

&gt; I packed whatever ability some people seem to have to just shut of the logical and reasoning part of their brain when it came to realizations they disagreed with.

Shutting down the logical and reasoning parts of the brain is a choice, and that choice is called **belief**: *choosing to adopt a particular worldview regardless of evidence of that worldview*.

---

I went through a similar experience to yours; I was religious through my childhood and adolescence and considered becoming a pastor because that was the closest to furthering a religious cause.

Like you, I sought out resources that challenged my thinking and eventually came to realize that I no longer actually believed in religion. Instead, I came to realize that I only believed I believed in religion. ""Belief in belief"".

Most religious people choose not to address the cognitive dissonance of that belief in belief. Instead, most religious people decide they prefer a world with an afterlife, where a guiding deity exists, where there are clear answers and where suffering is remedied through eternal reward.

It's a choice many religious people make--not usually a conscious choice, but yet a choice--to choose to live consistently with the belief that god exists because it's a worldview that brings comfort, while challenging that worldview brings both social discomfort and cognitive dissonance.

It's hard for people to break away from childhood indoctrination. Being willing to break away requires choosing the pain of dissonance rather than choosing to belief in god due to preferring a world in which god exists.

When you broke away from religion, did it hurt? Can you imagine people choosing to hide from that pain?

Edit:
&gt; Once all of the wires had been connected in my head and the cognitive dissonance no longer allowed me to ignore the truth that I had known deep down for a long time, I finally admitted to myself that I didn't believe anymore and I hadn't for years and I had only been telling myself I still did because it was so ingrained in me my entire life that I had no other choice; my faith was dead.

ihctb7m,Crazed_waffle_party,"There is growing support for ""Ranked Choice Voting"", which is an alternative to the ""winner take all"" election format in the U.S. 

RCV requires each voter to rank the candidates by most desirable to least. First, vote counters will see who received the most highest ranked votes. Let's say it was Donald Trump, receiving 30% of all high ranking votes. However, in a RCV system, the winner must receive 50% of the votes. 

Because no one received a majority, they then factor in the 2nd tier votes. Now Donald Trump has 30% of the first tier votes, but only 10% of the second tier votes. His current tally is now 20%. That's the beauty of RCV, it discourages politicians from alienating voters that do not prioritize them as first tier. Donald Trump in this scenario may have had 30% of first tier voters on his side, but he scorched the earth against everyone else. 

Let's also say Biden got only 20% of the first tier voters; however, 70% of voters choose him as their second choice. Suddenly, he went from being in Nth place to having 45% of the total vote. That's still not a clear majority, so we now add in people's third choice.

Although Biden was a lot of people's second choice, it appears that Elizabeth Warren, who had only 16% of the vote at this point, attracted a whopping 99% of third tier votes. That leaves Trump with 17% of the counted votes, Biden with 30%, and Warren with 44% of the vote.

The procedure will continue until all tiers are exhausted or until one politician gets a majority of counted votes. The benefit of this system is that no politician can confidently alienate one side to win over another. This system is used in many parliamentary Democracies and in the state of Maine.

ihcvbri,Castriff,"&gt;What will change my view is someone either pointing out a flaw in my logic and proving my statement is wrong, or proving that using our free will to choose to believe in God is not a requirement for a majority of Christian denominations.

I think the primary issue with your argument is a misconception about the definitions of ""faith"" and ""free will"" (or, perhaps more accurately, incomplete definitions of those things). I am not blaming you for this, though, because I think a *lot* of Christian denominations have lost track of these. This is what I believe: choosing to believe in God is a requirement for Christian denominations, but *not* a requirement for being right with God Himself.

You say that it was taught to you that ""Our faith in God is our free will."" I disagree. ""Free will"" and ""faith"" are not synonymous. Faith in God is an expression of free will. Our ability to make choices does indicate free will, but in that sense believing in God is just as much an expression of free will as not believing in Him. 

Faith, though, is not *only* belief in God, but also commitment to Him. It's a choice to follow what He tells us, and most importantly, to have a relationship with Him. When the Bible says ""we are saved by faith, not works,"" that means salvation is a result of striving to be righteous rather than only doing good actions. It is entirely possible to believe in God and then reject Him after the fact by intentionally choosing to ignore His influence through the Holy Spirit. Satan is the primary example, as someone else already mentioned, as when he was an angel he had the opportunity to talk to God on a daily basis. (Incidentally, this is also evidence that angels *do* have free will, not just humans.) It's also possible for a person to have a positive relationship with God without believing in God, simply by following one's conscience and trying to be a good person. All these things are also expressions of free will. So in that sense, certainty of God's existence doesn't negate the existence of faith. There's more that comes after that isn't necessarily implied by or connected to the former. 

I also think that it's flat-out wrong to say that ""bad things happening to good people"" or ""unanswered prayers"" or ""a lack of miracles"" are a result of God needing to build faith through the absence of blessings or evidence. God will give every human the opportunity to be righteous (again, even if they don't believe in Him) and faith in that sense might be tested during difficult times, but it increases because God gives reason and evidence to believe in His goodness *despite* the negative effects of sin in the world. 

Hopefully this makes sense. It's not exactly a majority view, but I do think it's well backed by the Bible.",2022-07-23 12:20:48,2022-07-23 12:20:48
ihd6lth,arhanv,"Have you ever heard of the Albanian system of blood feuds? I highly encourage you to read up about it. They have a system of laws known as the Kanun that allows people to avenge their loved ones if they are killed by another person. The fundamental problem with this is that *every* death has some stakeholders. 

If the parents or spouse of a murder victim are allowed to brutally kill the convicted person, wouldn’t the family of the perpetrator also be upset about this? Who gets to decide whose “vengeance” is more important? In systems of blood feud, this pretty much leads to a cycle of ruthless killing that goes on for centuries because everyone wants to avenge their loved ones. I know that the system you’re proposing is a more “civilized” take on capital punishment or retributive justice, but it’s been tested out in many different ways throughout global history and it never works out, because the legal system needs limits on its penal power to prevent it from descending into chaos. If we base all of our legal decisions on the idea of “revenge”, we need to have a clear definition of who deserves to exact “revenge” in every conceivable crime. What if a victim’s parents believe in non-violent punishment but their spouse wants to get their hands bloody? The current system isn’t perfect, but it’s much more consistent because we hand out similar punishments to every criminal who is accused of committing a particular crime (in theory).",2022-07-23 13:43:30,2022-07-23 13:43:30
ihd6nxn,breckenridgeback,"So OP, since this post couldn't be more obviously about *you* and *your* parents if it tried, I'm gonna talk to you for a little bit. I took a gander through your post history to get some context, and it sounds like you're very much like me when I was your age: a smart enough kid surrounded by some dumb evangelical family who are driving you up the wall.

-----

So, let's start with your main post, which has three parts:

* Grounding a child for &gt;2 weeks is *ineffective*

* Grounding a child for &gt;2 weeks *is morally wrong*.

and

* Grounding a child for &gt;2 weeks *should be illegal*.

First, do you recognize that there is a difference between these things? For example, it might be the case that it *is* effective at guiding a child's behavior, but is still wrong because it costs too much. Or it might be the case that it is both ineffective and immoral, but doesn't rise to the level of being worth adding legal interference in parenting.

I want to argue mostly against the third. I would guess that this probably *is* ineffective, and I'll even give you the benefit of the doubt that your parents were being unreasonable here (although, to be blunt, [your post history](https://www.reddit.com/r/insaneparents/comments/w58squ/faux_news_mom_still_refusing_to_even_note_trump/ih8xoxw/) suggests you mighta been asking for it a little). But that's a far cry from something being illegal.

The fact is that no, you will not face any permanent harm from not seeing your friends for a month. I'm sure it won't be very fun, and it might even be unjust, but it isn't abuse in and of itself. And unless it's abuse - and pretty egregious abuse at that - both American and almost every other culture in the world affords parents enormous leeway in how they treat their children by both law and by tradition. This has been the case throughout the history of civilization and around the world, so it's pretty safe to say that a wide range of cultures have largely come to agreement on it.

That doesn't *in itself* make it correct, but it does raise the burden of proof: if you want to overturn thousands of years of global tradition, you better have a good reason! (Actually, we already have overturned some of that tradition, in that you *would* have legal recourse if your parents beat you. But this is nowhere near that level. That said, [apparently your parents *have* tried to beat you with a switch, and *that* is not okay at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/terriblefacebookmemes/comments/vz8e8s/the_mystery_of_disrespectful_kids_today_has_now/iga1zqr/).)

To give you an idea of why we should generally not get the law involved in parenting - and I'll stick to a nice topical liberal example for this, since you and I are on the same side politically - imagine that you were just across the border in Idaho. And imagine you're a gay kid, with accepting parents. How much would you enjoy the state getting involved and saying they can't support who you are? 

(This isn't *the same* thing, in that that would clearly be an action with different moral value, but one of the things we have to be careful about to some extent in law is that we establish legal principles that work well even when people we disagree with are in control of them. Or at least, that's normally important, current insane circumstances notwithstanding.)

---------

As for due process: due process applies to a punishment *by the government*. Your parents are not bound by the fourth or fifth amendments, because they are not punishing you through the legal system. For a more adult-world example, neither is your employer, who can absolutely punish you with probable cause even if they cannot prove things beyond a reasonable doubt. (If you were arrested then yes, you as a minor would still have a legal right to due process. But that's a different matter.)

---------

&gt; [from a comment] don't break the rules assumes the rules are morally right, and the process by which you were determined to have broken said rules is infallible.

Well, no, not necessarily. There is some value in the rule of law and in consistent behavior even when the rules are not perfect or when their enforcement is fallible.

---------

More generally, and I'm gonna be a little bit blunt with you here: you probably aren't as smart as you think you are, and even your (apparently genuinely pretty nuts) parents probably have some worthwhile things to teach you.

You've learned some things, and you're standing up for your beliefs. Those are good things (although as an adult I have to tell you that this thread is *adorable* and comes off as far more childish than you probably think it does). But you are only at the beginning of your understanding of the world, as evidenced by your...loose grasp of the legal principles of due process.

So when you, the brilliant mastermind tactician who will [reveal how your mom is dumb](https://www.reddit.com/r/insaneparents/comments/w58squ/faux_news_mom_still_refusing_to_even_note_trump/ih8xoxw/) go into an argument with her, (a) you're not the tactician you think you are and (b) you're picking a dumb fight that has no possible benefit to you. When you [start dropping 9/11 conspiracy theories](https://www.reddit.com/r/insanepeoplefacebook/comments/w4a97h/the_planes_were_planed/ih2sout/), you demonstrate that you rely too much on your own reasoning and not enough on the expertise of others.

OP, I am very, very smart. By any measure - whether you go by my test scores, my income, my measured IQ, whatever - I am in the top fraction of a percent of the population, and I've worked hard to cultivate that intelligence. And you know what I've learned as I have? That figuring shit out is **really, really hard**. I think as hard as I can about relatively mundane business problems for my job, I get it wrong *all the time*, and I'm still considered pretty good at my job because I'm right maybe 25% of the time instead of the background 10. The biggest thing I've learned is how *little* I know, and how cautious I must be outside of my areas of expertise (while still being willing to take my best guess when I can). And even then, I still fuck that up sometimes.

Are you smarter than your family? Yeah, maybe, but being smarter than a rural religious conservative Trump fanatic isn't particularly hard. It's a low bar, is what I'm saying, and seeing the errors in their logic doesn't make you immune to errors in your own. And this thread is a good example: you've taken a way in which you're personally pissed off, taken the things you (half-)know, and tried to assemble it into a Grand Logical Truth instead of just a thing you don't like very much.

All of this is normal for your age. And so is me, as an adult, telling you about it, because it's also normal to grow out of these things, mature, and figure out how to both *have* beliefs *and* limit your certainty in them. There's a saying you've probably heard that ""a little knowledge is a dangerous thing"", and that's what it means: it means that you don't know what you don't know, and are trying to extend and extrapolate what you know with far more confidence than you ought to have at your current level of understanding.

Yeah, sure, but sometimes it's the best you can do. And in this case, the data I have about you is basically just from your posting.

&gt; also I really don't see what role my personality holds in a debate

It speaks to your biases and motivations. Humans are not perfect logical machines, and it's hard to avoid the influence of the people we are even when we're aware of that fact and really trying not to. It's all the harder when you have strong feelings on the subject and an ego tied up in it (as you seem to here).

&gt; thats almost an ad hominem but I will ignore it as your arguments seem well intentioned 

I'm not arguing to someone else that you're wrong because of who you are (which could be an ad hominem, although there are cases where - say, because someone is clearly arguing in bad faith - the background of a debate participate is relevant).

I'm trying to explain to *you* why *you* are wrong, and in order to do that, I need to help you understand the influence of parts of yourself that I don't think you see very well.

&gt; appeal to tradition and popularity in place of argument

Not in place of, but as a starting point.

No, the generality of a belief isn't a *guarantee* that it's true, but it's awfully good reason to think that it is. If you've got one person who thinks they've outsmarted the whole world, 99.9999% of the time, they are wrong. I don't even think that number is exaggerated: the number of people who can beat the whole world, even in their areas of expertise, is *really really small*.

&gt; revenge for arguing in somebody's own terms is not morally right

Well, one, I don't necessarily trust your reports here to not be a little self-serving. We are only getting your side, and again, based on the way you tend to talk, I'm gonna guess that you *were* being kind of a dick.

And for two, as previously established, we're distinguishing morality and legality here.

&gt;  secondly this post is entirely separated from any conflict in particular even if it does not appear to be(you will just have to take my word on this as there is no sufficient evidence to prove either way)

Well, no point debating it further, but idontbelieveyou.png

&gt; my ogp could be extended to include the moral question of punitive action: should we give the accused an opportunity to defend themselves(the age of the accused is not relevant in this question as in the context that this is asked the accused are all equal).

Sure, your parents probably should give you an opportunity to defend yourself, but again, that doesn't rise to any legal standard.

&gt; this is a problem with the structural form of government and a lacking constitution at the current moment not a reason why the government should not be involved in parenting in any way

Well, maybe, but we don't get to make policy in an ideal world where the government works exactly as we'd like it to, we have to make policy in *this* world in which we actually live. ""My thing would work perfectly if &lt;everything else were idealized&gt;"" is a really common and almlost entirely useless form of argument, because everything else never *is* idealized.

&gt; this is of course true but forgets that your employer is not allowed to punish you in a way not detailed in a hiring contract

Er...yes, they absolutely are. Your employer can fire you for almost any reason they like, with a few legally-protected exceptions (like your gender or race).

&gt; or that is already illegal ie placing you under defacto house arrest or theft of possessions.

No, because your employer does not have legal custody over you. Your parents, however, do, and those actions are within their custody rights.

&gt; secondly parents form a defacto government in relation to their child from which they should be protected

Well, maybe should, but aren't except in cases of gross abuse. Even if you want to argue they are a government, they're not one formed under the terms of the Constitution and its provisions don't apply to them.

&gt; this is a straight up ad hominem pick a better argument then my opposition is ignorant therefore his argument are worthless.

I've already explained why your arguments are incorrect. I'm trying to explain to you, as a person, why you are coming to those incorrect arguments - and how you can grow to have better ones.

&gt; I never claimed myself a brilliant mastermind tactician. I enjoy the process of humiliating those that have cause me suffering so it has benefit to me.

Remember when I said earlier that you were probably being kind of a dick? This is what I meant. What the hell did you think was gonna happen when you set out to ""humiliate"" the people who have significant control over your life? Not exactly a galaxy-brain move.

&gt; 9/11 is not relevant here but I just find myself skeptical of anything said by any authority and worth of questioning rather than automatic acceptance.

Yeah, that's a bad idea, is what I'm saying. Like yes, you should be *willing* to doubt such claims given good reason to do so, but ""authority said it so it's 50-50 whether it's true"" is a dumb approach that will make you wrong far more often than you're right.

&gt; again the age of a participants of a debate is irrelevant.

I don't think that's true. It doesn't automatically make the elder right and the younger person wrong, of course, but - well, remember a bit up this post when I was talking about how a person's background informs how they approach things and what biases they bring to the table?

The fundamental bias of youth is oversimplifying. You haven't had an opportunity to observe the ways in which rigid principles often fail in different situations, or to see just how complicated the patterns that make up the world are. That makes you overconfident in simple solutions. It doesn't mean you shouldn't look for solutions, or that you have nothing to contribute, it means you should take that bias into account when you do so.

&gt; secondly it is possible to extrapolate all past and future data from a collection of all present data in a system to a very high certainty.

It really isn't, even with exceptionally good data (more than you are likely in practice to ever have).

Most real-world systems are chaotic. That means (to oversimplify a bit) that errors in measurement grow exponentially over time. This is especially true of human systems, because a system that is well-understood tends to be exploited - and therefore have its dynamics changed - by the people who understand it. In other words, a social system that is well-understood tends to be unstable, meaning that social systems actively *avoid* comprehensibility by the individuals that comprise them.

&gt; therefore(regardless of the irrelevance of this point) the more I know the more I can extrapolate about the past future and present with growing certainty.

Well, let me put it this way: if you can predict things with such certainty, pick some small problem - say, on the scale of 50 or 100 people - and try to solve it through that predictive ability, with no excuses for failure (you don't get to go ""but if other people would just-"", for example). I think you'll be surprised at how challenging you find it.

&gt; morally speaking there is no reason why suffering should be inflicted unnecessarily on the innocent I hope we can agree on that one thing

Sure, but ""unnecessarily"" and ""innocent"" are doing a lot of work in this sentence.

---

&gt; but any argument with a correct conclusion reached through a flawed mechanism of argument the same conclusion can also be reached with an unflawed argument. because of this I will disregard any argument containing any flaws in logic with a response naming the type of fallacy it contains if it is blatantly obvious to contain an example of a textbook fallacy.

Fallacies - and their overzealous application - are not the be-all and end-all of logical reasoning.

&gt; biases and motivations are subservient to a logical argument and should be treated as such deal with the logic first biases and motivations second.

Actual conversations like the ones we're engaged in are subject to lots of interpretation between the argument itself and its formal structure.

For example:

* People should have freedom and rights (proposition P)
* It's important to guide children to correct behavior (proposition Q)
* Grounding children for a month is a good idea (proposition R)

You could easily write something like P -&gt; not R, or Q -&gt; R. But that's not really embedding the full logical connective tissue, because the statement P -&gt; not R requires a bunch of additional statements (namely that grounding children is a violation of freedom or rights), and in fact the fact that everyone already agrees proposition P isn't universal to begin with. Similarly, Q -&gt; R contains underlying statements like ""grounding children effectively changes their behavior"", and ignores the fact that Q itself is not absolute.

Reasoning in the real world tends to fail for those connective reasons as much or more than it does because of formal fallacies. Everyone agrees that \exists x | x \in S does not imply \forall x | x \in S, but that's not usually the point of failure. The choice of characterization matters a lot, as do the input facts.

&gt; of course im arguing my position from a minors point of view so I of course could directly serve to potentially benefit from the installment of a policy as describe in my ogp a bias I am aware of. unless that bias causes a falsehood or fallacy to be argued then it is managed and not relevant. 

I mean, it has - among other things, you've (falsely) claimed that the due process provisions of the Constitution apply to parental treatment.

&gt; coincidentally looking at a list of logical fallacy this fall nicely into an appeal to motive.

_frustrated head pounding into desk_

Your argument wasn't a logical one in the first place. You're arguing *from*, and as a result of, that motive. The motive is highly relevant.

&gt; bad faith. secondly arguing in kind with somebody who argues in bad faith is equivalent and thus net neutral gain or loss if you are more skilled with word than them then that is their personal problem. 

I'm not following this bit.

I don't think you're here in bad faith. Presenting a biased account that you don't *know* it biased isn't bad faith.

&gt; note the golden rule here treat people how you want to be treated and so if my parent argues in a condescending manner about anything than it is not morally wrong to do the same in the same time.

The golden rule does not say that retaliation is ethical. It's a guide for *your* actions, not someone else's. [Lex talionis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_for_an_eye) is ancient law, not modern ethics, and it is absolutely possible for *both* people in a conflict to be assholes.

&gt; this right here seems to be the core of the debate, the place of disagreement.

Well, yes.

&gt; I believe the necessary severity for any punishment to be given legal consideration is lower

Then I don't think you know the law very well. And I sincerely doubt this is a claim you've made any effort to verify. You spend any time skimming through Washington State family law and precedent? I'm betting not.

&gt; I believe this could be resolved quite simply, for groundings over 2 weeks an appeal is submitted requiring an unbiased third party(not necessarily a judge just an unbiased(unbiased as maximally possible) third party) and a jury of peers of the accused in low number maybe 10 or 12 maximum.

This is, to put it mildly, grossly impractical. (Also, ""jury of peers""? Are you trying to create juries of frustrated teenagers here?)

&gt; the number of groundings over 2 weeks would likely decrease as the process becomes more lengthy.

Yeah, and this is where we get at some of the heart of what you're about. You're not looking for due process, you're looking for extra burden to produce the outcome you want. Imagine, say, that there weren't any logical hassle to the parents in bringing such a ""case"", so that it creates no burden to imposing such punishments. Would that change your opinion of whether it's a good idea?

&gt; don't care was totally worth it. ie the consequences were less than the reward for me.

Then stop complaining about the consequences, lol.

&gt; I argued insufficiently here. I meant that everything said by authority should be examined not blanketly stated as unlikely because it was said by authority.

Such ""examination"" is more likely to produce a false positive from something you don't understand than a true positive where you identify a problem with it, at least in cases where the claim is coming from experts who have devoted proper study to the subject. This sort of reasoning is what leads to the 1 x 1 = 2 guy.

&gt; true but that assumes the conditions in which my policy works must be perfect and cannot be flawed to work.

Your policy would certainly not work within the current legal system.

Assuming that parents, on average, impose such a punishment 5 times through a child's upbringing (which I think is roughly what it would work out to if you looked at my own childhood? I don't have a great number, but let's use it to ballpark). Let's say the ""trial"" takes one work day, with a jury of 12 and some form of skilled-labor administrator (like a judge).

That is, per trial, something like 12 (jurors) \* $14.49 (WA state min wage) \* 8 hours (workday) = about $1,400. Judges are highly educated, but let's assume it's just a random administrator who makes, say, $50 an hour on average, that adds another $50 \* 8 = $400, for $1800 total. You've got administrative costs to file and keep track of results - those are hard to estimate, so I'm going to bake them into rounding up to $2000.

Times five times during a child's upbringing is $10,000 of extra rearing costs per child. There are [83,101](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/Documents/Pubs/422-099-2020-2010-VitalStatHighlights.pdf) live births in WA state per year, most of whom survive to adulthood, meaning that this amounts to an extra cost of around $800 million annually. That means you're devoting about 3% of WA state's *total* tax revenue to disputes over grounding children.

&gt; I mean all of the data, really like absolutely all of it.

You never, ever have that, even with the resources of major governments backing you. An approach that relies on data you never ever have is a *bad approach*. You need approaches that are robust to error.",2022-07-22 20:58:46,2022-07-23 13:43:56
ihdah7d,PreacherJudge,"I read your post twice, and I'm just not putting together your argument for why faith isn't a choice.  It's clear you feel your loss of faith wasn't a choice, but I'm not sure why, and I don't see where you justify generalizing that out.

As some background, I've always been a little confused about this.  I see people say, ""I can't just make myself believe something,"" and that's never made much sense to me. 

It might be useful to get into the nature of a belief... what do you think that is?

---

&gt; I believe that some people have the capacity to genuinely truly believe things despite a lack of evidence or evidence to the contrary, and I believe some people don't.

This capacity is just called ""imagination.""  And yes, imaginative capacity absolutely varies across people.

...but I suspect you bristled when I called this imagination, and I think the reason might be in this ""truly believe"" term you used.  As in, the person has to imagine and then to forget they're using your imagination, or something like that.

But this was my point in asking about beliefs, because I think you might be smuggling a lot into the definition, and teasing all that out would be helpful.  So using your phrasing, I'll clarify I'm asking about what you mean when you say ""a trust that something is real.""  

Here's one specific aspect, in case it'll help communication.  Do you think beliefs *necessitate action*?  In other words, if I bite into the apple as if it was just an ordinary apple, then I couldn't have ""truly believed"" it was blue (and thus probably artificial)?",2022-07-23 13:13:17,2022-07-23 14:11:55
ihdc2m6,Genoscythe_,"&gt;At this point, one must accept that words like rtard are perfectly legitimate given society's general opinion towards mental capacity, but they still hurt the feelings of those they truly describe and therefore should be avoided (at least when referring to those people). But I don’t see an issue when they are made in reference to objects or actions “hey that’s rtarded” “this chair is r\*tarded” or just uttered without any referent such that no one’s feelings are being hurt.  


I think you are getting this entirely backwards. 

The reason why (some of us) don't want to hurt the feelings of people with mental disabilities, is exactly because we **don't want to perpetuate** those general opinions of society. 

In any context where calling someone a ""retard"" is synonymous with calling them a fool, a nincompoop, a loser, a fuckup, a clown, it is not really about evaluating their mental ability, it is about demeaning someone who you dislike or who made an annoying mistake, by comparing them to someone mentally disabled. 

The complaint in the first place is that ***this is worng***, because the mentally disabled shouldn't be demeaned like that, whether you are comparing a chair or a person that you dislike to them, they themselves are fine. 

IF you are starting out with the position that devaluing low intelligence is in itself okay, then what are you even trying to spare the ""hurt feelings"" of ""those they truly describe"" from? 

If you might not call them a retard to their face, but also behind their backs you are openly making the argument that they have less ""value"" than mentally healthy people, that's not more respectful, just more cowardly.",2022-07-23 14:23:29,2022-07-23 14:23:29

I have a feeling you have a market oriented mindset. Perhaps you see relationships as a quasi-contract where both parties must gain value for it to be legitimized. If at some point in time a partner believes they are worse off in the relationship than they would be single, the contract becomes illegitimate; the frustrated partner has the moral high grounds to leave. 

But, the frustrated partner also has the freedom to negotiate. That is their choice, and considering the transaction has been delegitimized, it can be as seen charitable. They realize that if their bf/gf made some concession, both sides could reach mutual benefit again and continue the relationship. The ultimatum is not unethical, it's business! If a lover is unreasonable with their demands, they will lose value on the market of love. They are only hurting themselves, really. If their value drops too much, they'll have to reconsider their way of life. Thus, any problem with ultimatums are self correcting via market style forces.

But, relationships cannot be seen as impersonal transactions. The analogy breaks down once you introduce nuance. 

Fundamentally, all relationships are about shared life planning. Couples move in, share finances, and plan around each other. That is the base contract of a relationship. But that also means there is some vulnerability involved. One survey of 2002 adults found that 20% of women have delayed ending a relationship because of financial worries. In many cases, partners have sacrificed their professional prospects for their partners. A common example is when a mother will reduce her work obligations to take care of a child, so the father can focus more efforts on his professional success. In many of these cases, an ultimatum is nuanced because it can be perceived as an act of financial coercion. Financial coercion is clearly unethical.

So, someone cannot spam ultimatums unless they've considered the power dynamic and how much autonomy their partner really has. That makes it difficult to claim absolute morality while issuing an ultimatum. 

They can be reasonable, but an explanation is required that take precedence over power dynamics. The below is an example of how an ultimatum should go.

""Honey, I care deeply about you, but I got in this relationship because I thought it would mutually enhance our lives. However, your loud music keeps me up at night. It strains my ears and robs me of meditation. I love you, but your music is degrading my health. I am thinking of us, but I'm also thinking of my own self-preservation. If you cannot change your habits around music, I will have to leave for my own health. The relationship cannot make me happy when it also makes sick.""

In the above example, which parallels the one you provided, it is clear that the person has a defendable and rational reason. If someone were to make regular demands against their partner without justifying them, that could become abusive and fast.",2022-07-23 17:22:32,2022-07-23 18:32:55

However, ""overwhelmingly lower quality of life"", is vastly narrow sighted.

The problems we have currently are real issues, but the problems of the past cannot be dismissed. The past isn't a great place either in numerous aspects: slavery, colonial powers, extreme inequality of race/gender, apartheid, literal war, lack of medical, etc... Imagine growing up during the great depression which extended to world war 2. Imagine your entire country is unemployed, and not knowing where their next meal would come from, then when your finally old enough to help your family, your at war in the front lines of a foreign country.

Transition care for young people is pretty rare and is applied pretty conservatively to people who are quite sure they want to transition. And even then, it's largely-reversible (yes, reversible, spare me your panicked TERF/right-wing fearmonger articles, inevitable replies, I promise I've seen every single one) puberty blocking medications for a while before any cross-sex hormone treatment. And when you study outcomes from people who transition at that age, they [don't regret it](https://www.hbrs.no/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/young-adult-outcome-after-puberty-suppression-2014-de-Vries.pdf) any more than (and perhaps somewhat *less* than) adult transitioners do.

&gt; I’m sure it could very well begin at that age but there’s also more confusion now because things are so pointlessly gendered. Like dresses, like dolls. Like really anything.

You think there's *more* gendered stuff now? 

I'm not that old, and within my lifetime, there was a whole media trope of ""you're a *girl* but you &lt;something practical&gt;"" and it was taken somewhat seriously.

I would say that there is far, far more freedom for people of both sexes to explore gender-non-conforming behavior now than there has ever been before.

&gt; If it takes and holds until you’re old enough to actually navigate your own life then great!

Well, ""great"", except you're now stuck with the physical consequences of your natal puberty and missed out on a critical developmental window because you were too busy feeling awful. The teenage years are when most people learn how to interact with others and, critically, how to form sexual and romantic relationships. When you have a serious issue with your sexed body, you're going to have one hell of a time doing that, and you don't just get a redo later in life. You end up having to learn what everyone else already knows ten or fifteen years later.

&gt; But to reinforce something like that with a label like ‘egg’ at an early age HAS to be putting your thumb on the scales, does it not?

Well, like I said, /r/egg_irl is probably a bit trigger happy here. If I were talking to a potentially-trans person in their early teens - which is not a hypothetical since I've done it dozens of times - I'd adopt a more cautious stance. But I think it's going too far to say they definitely *aren't* an 'egg', since, again, every adult trans person was once a young trans person.

ihetc91,Concrete_Grapes,"I wish i could counter this.   


the only way i might be able to is say that millennials hit the dip harder, and you all might come out better than they did by some tiny fractional margin.   


Like, gen-x, did even better, in terms of wealth, than boomers did--and they're outpacing the wealth generation as a share of the population, faster than ANY generation ever has--it's astonishing.   


Compared to them, millennials are earning right now, about half of what they are. Adjusted for inflation, millennials are earning a little less than 1/4th the money (compared to buying power), that boomers did in the SAME JOBS in the 60's and 70's, at comparable ages.   


Millennials will NEVER--never, have an 'average age' for becoming a home owner, because more than half dont own one, and their ownership rate is going DOWN now that the oldest are 41.   


Gen X's wealth went up 65% in the pandemic--millennials went DOWN.   


Millennials control or own about 4% of the national wealth. When boomers were our age, they owned 26%.   


... so, considering how astonishing bad millennials have it, there's some SMALL chance your generation will do better ...   


Like, economists expect, by 2030, gen z to start flat out out-earning millennials. Which would be horrific--since millennials would be the age that gen-x is now, and gen x is earning double what millennials do (when you compare household incomes). That means millennials are predicted to NOT recover, while gen-z is on track to out-earn us.   


So--as far as economic power, gen-z may have the luck. They may be alive at the right time to see boomers pass, and property held by them (over half of it) to trickle into new hands. This is happening right NOW to the silent AND boomer generations as they die--but the wealth is passing to gen-x, not millennials (often the youngest children of boomers--or children of the oldest gen-x instead).   


It's possible that your generation, gen-z, can see the passing of the wealth from boomers and gen-x--and that it will skip millennials, while part of your generation uses the wealth of their millennial parents to supplement their life..   


So.. MAYBE.   


As far as climate, yeah, currently, you're fucked.   


However, i think in 10-15 years carbon capture, and 'clean fuel' is going to replace drilling for oil. We're going to see it catch like CRAZY--because it will be carbon negative fuel for cars, trucks, boats, planes--and the carbon PPM in the atmosphere will probably start to drop around the time your generation reaches 50... and the time millennials are dying in their old folks home from heat strokes when the AC goes out.   


Evidence for this is corporations like BP, Shell, Exxon, cutting their drilling and production goals by 40% or more by 2030--their peak drilling was in 2018/2019, and even NOW they're not upping that goal. They're preparing for carbon capture, and i think they see it coming, and are preparing for the transition--their old oil wells are going to become sites for capture..

ihetoci,MurkingDolphins,"I feel like I had a lot of thoughts about where I fit when I was that age. It wasn’t until I thought back that I actually connected the dots to the things i can tell with hindsight have impacted me as an adult.

I’m sure it could very well begin at that age but there’s also more confusion now because things are so pointlessly gendered. Like dresses, like dolls. Like really anything. As a kid more than ever you SHOULD be allowed to explore things freely.

If it takes and holds until you’re old enough to actually navigate your own life then great! It it turns out to be a passing fancy then whatever - that’s not who you are. 

But to reinforce something like that with a label like ‘egg’ at an early age HAS to be putting your thumb on the scales, does it not?

I concede my viewpoint changed. This thread has helped me see a scenario in which I would take my sibling seriously about transitions.

This scenario would heavily revolve around a very professional therapist without hidden motivations like some scam mechanic. But, if a therapist could genuinely prove to me that my sister WANTED that, I would support her.

I went through male puberty. I don’t like my body, I thought for a long time that was normal and frankly I still do. Im just gonna live happy as I can though and hope I see a time where I can upload myself into virtual reality.

ihf0wk4,JohnnyNo42,"Leaving aside all arguments about free will, believing or not can be as much of a choice as deciding whether to order pizza or sushi. The human mind has powerful mechanisms to deal with cognitive dissonance. True believers are able to ignore arbitrary facts and still stay true to their faith. Sure, not everybody is able to do that kind of mental gymnastics. Some people are simply doomed to look at the facts and attempt to derive their belief from reality, but then again ... not everybody is made to be a true believer ...

---

Your original challenge - just focusing on the TLDR - does not require the choice to be available to *everyone*. The Bible itself makes clear that salvation is more difficult to obtain for some than it is for others. E.g. it is specifically difficult for rich people to enter the kingdom of god. Similarly, why shouldn't it be specifically difficult for some people to obtain salvation by choosing to believe?

---

I don't believe that rational thinking is a incurable ailment that would make it physically impossible for some people to believe. In my experience, even the most rational minds have some breaking point at which they start believing weird things. So there is hope for salvation for everyone after all.

---

Ok, now I see where you are coming from. Tbh, I'm mostly in line with your understanding of neuropsychology. Not sure about the details, but people's brains are clearly different in their perception of religion, spirituality and their ability to suppress cognitive dissonance.

Anyway, using that as a reason to invalidate religion mixes fundamentally different levels of argumentation. Believers, by your own argument, wouldn't be disturbed by logical or scientific contradiction. And anyone sufficiently scientifically-minded to accept this argument would have left religion a long time ago.

So, the first group of people would reject your logic to begin with. The second group would consider religion invalid simply because it contradicts reality to begin with, not because of the unfairly different predispositions of being able to believe in it.",2022-07-23 08:04:14,2022-07-23 22:56:55

If you have any sort of historical awareness, yes, they did.

After WWII, the government got corporations to build them nice homes and sell them to GIs at a near zero percent interest rate. When the average salary was $3.5K, these homes cost just over $5K (and given that many of them were in the military and didn't pay for anything, they had giant nest eggs waiting when they got out).  They also got free education, an economic advantage over literally the entire rest of the globe due to not being leveled during WWII, and plentiful corporate pensions. Even if you had no skill, you could still raise a family on a single salary in a home you could own in a reasonable amount of time. Then, when they got ready to retire, they pulled up the ladder behind them. They ended corporate pensions in favor of 401Ks and reaped the benefits as their investments ballooned with all the money pouring into the stock markets. Those motherfuckers died fat and happy.

I never claimed that my generation had it particularly hard. I'm an Xer. What am I going to complain about aside from a few wars they sent us into and some hardcore parental emotional abandonment?  And I definitely would have preferred their way of life and the way they got to make a living to my own. My family spent 7 generations within 40 miles of New Orleans before I had to move hundreds of miles away for work.  Virtually every hobby I had was tied up in the wetlands of that area, and all the cultural things I grew up cherishing are things that are completely foreign to people where I live.  

I don't find arguments about the Depression and WWII to be compelling because, well, the Depression happened when they were young children, and WWII was a 4 year moment of lives that spanned 100 years.

Statements like this don't do much for your case. Raw numbers don't tell the full story. There's a lot more to it than the numbers.

I can say that ""Person X gets 1,000 times as much food as Person Y"", but if Person Y is getting all the food he needs and is generally content with his situation, then this statement isn't a big deal. 

Comparing the average poor person today who has food stamps, food banks, rental assistance, section 8 housing and usually doesn't pay any taxes (Earned Income Tax Credit) to someone who is being taxed into starvation and destitution isn't a good comparison, no matter how the actual numbers look.

Now, as far as your main claim, that sorta remains to be seen. Yes, you're right, there have been backwards strides lately.

What you are experiencing is a very common phenomenon. For example, consider this survey question:

""In the last 20 years, the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty has:
□   A: almost doubled 
□   B: remained more or less the same 
□   C: almost halved""

Although the correct answer to this is ""C"", fewer than one in ten people randomly surveyed get it correct (significantly worse than random chance... Chimps throwing at dartboards would do better).

In your situation, there are likely two things going on here that are both true: (i) you've identified real and troubling concerns; and (ii) you've systematically overweighted those concerns while also missing and underweighing positive trends.

So signs of sex are negative. But procreation is good and signifies creating a family and stability. So signs of sex after sex feel to these people like they aren't having sex just for procreation but are wild and sinning. That's the core where it comes from. And then we have the patriarchy and the whole/madonna complex etc. It shouldn't be this way, but it is this way. And it's consistent with how they believe the world works.

\&gt; Renewable energy is growing at exponential rates. If we only confine ourselves to solar and wind globally, the rate of growth is doubling every 3.75 years. Even if we round this up to 4, these two energies alone will provide more power in 2034 than was generated globally in 2021.

\&gt; Artificial intelligence is advancing at remarkable rates, which may have massive implications for productivity. As productivity rates rise, in theory, so does income per capita. Of course, those gains need to be properly redistributed throughout the workforce, but that's a different challenge. Yes, AI could potentially have a number of terrible implications as well, but let's focus on the bright side here.

\&gt; Microbiological advances. The rapid creation of the Covid-19 vaccination was attributable to a variety of amazing advances and innovations in microbiology. These advances will continue and, in fact, speed up due to machine learning techniques (e.g., quickly determine new ways of protein folding). This might well mean that Gen Z is to be the healthiest and longest-living generation in  history.

\&gt; Advances in political systems. I agree the US as well as many other nations are in danger of turning away from democracy and toward totalitarianism. However, at the same time, there are various grassroots movements (e.g., [Represent.US](https://Represent.US)) that seek to reform the more corrupt and dysfunctional aspect of government.   There may be a flowering of such movements, eventually leading not just to more democracy but to more functional forms of democracy than have ever existed.

\&gt; Ecosystem improvements. Humanity has done an enormous amount of harm to the global ecosystem, but, along with the advancement in renewables, there will also be more programs such as [30x30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_by_30), which is  is a worldwide initiative for governments to designate 30% of Earth's land and ocean area as protected areas by 2030. So, Gen Z may have access to a cleaner and less disrupted planet than any generation in the last 100 years.

Wikipedia:
&gt; The origin of the term has been attributed to legislators, the firearms industry, gun control groups,[4][5][6] and the media.[7] It is often used interchangeably with the term ""assault rifle"",[8] which traditionally refers to selective fire rifles that use intermediate cartridges.[6]

Miriam-Webster:
&gt; : any of various automatic or semiautomatic firearms
&gt; especially : ASSAULT RIFLE

Note from Wiktionary:
&gt; There is no universally accepted definition of an assault weapon, and the meaning varies between jurisdictions. However, according to defunct United States federal legislation, any semi-automatic rifle is an assault weapon if it has a detachable magazine and has two or more of the following: pistol grip, folding or telescoping stock, bayonet mount, flash suppressor, grenade launcher.

Collins Dictionary:
&gt; assault rifle
&gt; in British English
&gt; or assault weapon
&gt; NOUN
&gt; mainly US
&gt; a firearm that is capable of firing multiple rounds in a very short period

dictionary.com limits ""assault weapon"" to military weapons:
&gt; any of various automatic and semiautomatic military firearms utilizing an intermediate-power cartridge, designed for individual use.

Concerning Basic and Human rights, you should take a look at the actual Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

While you might disagree with the SCOTUS decision, it was not an outright ban, but the empowering of the states to decide, perhaps this even might be important in the future if the Federal government tries an outright ban.

Personally I think a very negative narrative is being spread, especially amongst the younger generations. There is a clear intent of using this to motivate and drive people into activism (sometimes with the right reasons), but a side effect is this feeling you have that everything is going so bad that nothing can be done, that's the dangerous part.

Truth be told, the world is always on the brink of chaos. The last 20 years were probably the best and most secure ever. Through the 60's to 80's there was the looming threat of nuclear war, imagine that. Living everyday in constant fear of  mutually assured Destruction.

Not to mention that you probably live on one of the best places on earth, with the best chances of financial success. Being born in America is basically EASY mode for life, try surviving in a third world country and you quickly learn how blessed and lucky you are, maybe even feel worst about what you have done with so much it was given to you.

Politics might feel really bad now, but trust me it is not as bad as it seems. USA is still a functioning democracy with periodical change of leadership. Maybe DEMs and REPs gotta go sometime and new parties rise to break the bipartisanship, but no rush, democracies take their sweet time to change, and that's is good, too fast and you have coup-d'etats every ten years.

About the weather, seriously is just a guessing game. Either way, human ingenuity has proven itself time-after-time as a powerful force. Ever heard about Thomas Robert Malthus ? He also thought the world was set for a disaster, convinced a lot of people, but 150 years later we are still striving.

On Wealth inequality, 1800's France was a hellish place compared to the USA today. Comparing these so different moments/countries is very tricky. I would take 100x an unequal place over a equal where everyone is dirt poor.

The dynamics of economic development have change so much, consider that now you don't need to own land, machines, workshops and etc to be productive and or inventive. Owning land used to be discretionary, only the King/State could allow you to own, even if you had the money for it. Setting up a factory workshop used to cost TONS of money, in loans, only given to a few selected ones. The advent of computers and internet changed the game completely, even if you get dealt a shitty hand in life, there is a good chance you can improve it.

Because, ""Sexy book with hot bdsm"" was the level of analysis it got from most people.

---

&gt;That quote does not contain the words “b.d.s.m.” however and you said the writer said so.

This argument is like, so dumb to me. If she doesn't think this is domestic abuse, what do you think she thinks it is? What lifestyle is she refering to?

&gt;I was around during the controversy but I never read the books but I mostly indeed remember that everyone knew it wasn't “b.d.s.m.” due to it's lack of consent. Everywhere I saw people talk about it this much was clear. It was mostly an argument between the defenders that realized it was non-consensual, but said it was fiction and that there is no problem  with crimes and villain in fiction, and those that argued that it went too far even for fiction.

I have to ask, how much time were you spending reading what the kink community said, vs like day time news? This book wasn't mainly read by kinky people. Kinky people hated it due to a mix of really poor writing, and a bad portrayal of BDSM. This book broke into the day time tv, suburban mom audience. They weren't even having a conversation on abuse vs bdsm.

&gt;Was it? Because I mostly see many people complaining about people supposedly getting it wrong, but no actual person who does and I find this to be a common thing with many things, people complaining in such a fashion about a problem that doesn't seem to actually occur but they all start to believe it occurs because they see others complain.

The problem you're running into is that, if you're invested enough into the online kink spaces to be arguing about 50 shades of gray, you probably agree with the online kink community. You seem to have completely missed the mainstream fad of these being the hot sexy bdsm book suburban moms would read 

&gt;Can you actually remember instances you saw with your own eyes where people called it “b.d.s.m.” rather than people who complained about it being called that?

Have you talked to any  non-kink involved person about this?

---

&gt;I would think rape and similar things. Though I understand your position re-reading. To-be clear, there is a not-insignificant number of persons who actively change their habits to increase the chance of being raped or molested or something similar and I had assumed it refers to that but I also now realize that perhaps not many persons know this exists.

I'm sorry, but if your reading of her comment is so skewed that it could be refering to the lifestyle of trying to get yourself raped then I think you're genuinely not equipped to have this conversation.

&gt;Then surely you can produce some kind of forum post? Because all I see when I search for this title in conjunction with the term “b.d.s.m.” is criticism that it is not that.

ihixosg,Tommyblockhead20,"I am not a climate expert, but I am friends with one. Climate change will likely not make much of the US uninhabitable in our lifetime. 

The main concerns with climate change is 1, in much poorer countries where they cannot afford to mitigate and respond to the effects of climate change like drought, sea level rise, and natural disasters, and 2, the much longer term irreversible damage, that our future generations will experience if we don't sufficiently change how we live.

The effects we will see in the US: prices will go up due to developed countries being reliant on poor developing nations for goods, many climate migrants, increased natural disasters, drought which could make desert cities like Las Vegas less livable, and sea level rise, which will force people living right on the coast inland if they cannot afford sea walls.

But like I said, I'm not an expert so don't quote me on that.

Climate scientists always give the worst case scenario, for if we don't change what we are doing. While that is good to scare people into action, it shouldn't make people feel depressed/helpless, because the fact is, things are changing. In just the last decade, solar and wind energy has plummeted in price (and batteries to enable them), electric cars have gone mainstream, there is more political will, and more. Global CO2 emissions are still going up, but they are slowing down. While it is expensive and there will be suffering, humans are generally pretty good at preserving through hardships. Look at how fast we made a Covid vaccine. For water, desalinization has gotten much cheaper, and likely will continue to do so, especially since much of the cost is energy, and solar and wind energy costs continue to drop.

Climate change is bad, but I like to be opportunistic. I mean, using the same pessimistic methodology, boomers had it even worse since they were all going to die in a nuclear apocalypse.",2022-07-24 08:55:16,2022-07-24 19:02:39

ihjrczb,timberlin,"Pilot, here, so I'll see what I can do.....

**Lack of Control**

I can absolutely empathize with this feeling.  What I can say are the individuals in control of a commercial airliner are some of the most experienced aviators on the planet who have undergone years of rigorous training to get to the point that you cross paths.  They are significantly more skilled at operating their machinery than the average driver out on the road.  For whatever reason, driving an automobile doesn't garner the fear and respect it should, so everyone takes it for granted.  Think of how many distracted drivers there are out on the road, who at any time can slam into your car with no chance for reaction on your end.  Though you are controlling YOUR car, you are not controlling theirs, so in a very practical sense, you are not nearly in as much control of your fate as you might prefer to be.  A question I would ask you though, is do you feel the same discomfort riding passenger in an automobile as you do a plane?

**Flying in Inclement Weather**

Your concern is completely warranted as severe weather can very easily take a plane down and is often a root cause in aviation mishaps; however, for that reason, it is equally a concern for those flying the plane.  Before every flight, I can assure you that your pilot has thoroughly reviewed the forecast throughout the route of flight, as well as over a wide time range to account for delays.  If too dangerous and unable to avoid this weather, aircrews may alter the route of flight, amend take-off windows to slip into a safer line, or choose altogether to not enter into a region of severe weather.  If this doesn't put your mind at ease, commercial airlines have incredibly sophisticated onboard weather radars to provide real-time updates as the flight progresses.  This is further backed up by ground weather radar systems that are relayed up to the pilot by Air Traffic Control (ATC) to further expand the picture to the pilots.  On the rare occasion that these systems are not able to provide adequate information, pilots will often report unexpected conditions to ATC through something called a PIREP (pilot report), so this information can be relayed to other aircraft in the area.  Lastly, and most importantly, don't discount eyeballs and experience.  With the thousands of hours under their belts, commercial pilots are not stupid and will not fly directly into a cumulonimbus that they see off the nose, regardless of what a radar picture says.

**Airborne Emergencies**

This is something I would say should be the furthest from your worries.  The image of flaming aviation wreckage triggers really visceral emotions deep within nearly everyone.  I won't continue to pound the drum of statistics in this regard, but you need to understand that catastrophic aviation emergencies are effectively a rounding error.   Safety is paramount in everything we do in aviation.  If there is an accident, panels of experts deep dive into every root cause, this information is processed, and then it is presented to the larger aviation community.  From there, we study it extensively, learn from those mistakes, aligning policy, design, and training to prevent similar mistakes from occurring again.  Because of this culture, our processes for handling emergencies are well laid out.  Aircraft are equipped with countless sensors and automation to attempt prevent failures altogether, but at a minimum, present this information quickly to the pilots to act.  Aircraft undergo maintenance and inspections at a much more frequent clip than anything you have experienced with automobiles.  On top of this, pilots are trained extensively on their equipment and we have access to thousands of pages of technical documentation and checklists in the air to help us work through any equipment failures.  I don't say this to scare you, but it is very likely that you have been on a flight with an emergency, but the safety redundancies in design and well laid out procedural guidance quickly and quietly solved the problems with you being none the wiser.  On the chance that none of this fixes the issue and a expedited landing needs to occur, emergency aircraft have complete priority in the air.  ATC opens the Red Sea, pushing any potential conflicts in the air out of the way to minimize air time for the emergency aircraft.

&amp;#x200B;

ihk2mwe,rollingForInitiative,"I live in Sweden and I'm a software developer. I'm quite sure that if I lived in the US, I would have more money over at the end of the day.

But I wouldn't want to live there anyway. In Sweden, I'll have access to healthcare regardless of my job. If I want to take a job at a small company - or even if I become unemployed - I'll never have to pay more than like $30 to go to the ER and have whatever treatments required for whatever happened. I'll never have to pay more than $120 for healthcare per year *at all*, because that's the maximum you pay. Nor will I have to witness the struggles of friends and family who just cannot afford it.

I could come down with diabetes, and know that I will get insulin for free. If I got HIV, I'd get HIV meds for free.

I'm not planning on having children, but if I did, I wouldn't have to save money for their college fund, because education doesn't cost anything.

I also know that regardless of where I work, I will always be legally entitled to 25 paid vacation days per year, and a legal right to 11 hours of consecutive daily rest and 36 hours of consecutive weekly rest. I'll have unlimited sick days as well.

And regardless of where I work, there's always a hard cap on how much ordered overtime you can work - for instance, never more than an average of 48 hours over 4 weeks, unless there's some kind of force majeure (like a pandemic for healthcare workers).

And even though my salary is lower than in the US, I make significantly more than the median income. So much more that I can work at reduced hours, have a day off every other week, and *still* make much more than the median salary.

Also, I don't even have a driver's license, which seems to be something that you much more frequently need in the US than here.

&gt;Btw what is the point of having so much free weeks in a year while your wage will not allow you to travel as much and as hard as americans do in a few days

Most Swedes do? I've been abroad twice in the last two months. A lot of people go abroad in the Summer, to places like Spain or Greece. Going abroad 1-3 per year is super common among ""professionals"".

And that doesn't even cover domestic travel. A lot of people have summer homes in the countryside where they'll spend their vacations. Or they'll just hang around at home. Since most people use most of their vacation in the summer, you'll usually have time off at the same time as friends. So you can go on road trips, go swimming, do BBQ's or just hang around chilling.

And if you're actually short on money - maybe you're a student - you can travel across Europe much cheaper than travelling to the other side of the world. But your post is about people who have money, and people who have money can travel.

So yeah, I'll take the guarantee of more spare time, easily working fewer hours, guaranteed healthcare for both myself and everyone I love, and free education instead of some extra $$$.",2022-07-25 02:26:20,2022-07-25 02:26:20

ihk9vvo,I_am_the_night,"&gt;So this argument has gone on long enough. I’m not sure anyone has a clue when and where or even why it started ( I’m assuming it was for political votes [thats my opinion]). 

I mean, there's probably not a specific starting point in terms of ""when or where"", but the ""why"" is pretty straightforward and not at all as cynical as you make it out to be: people fight for the equal treatment and acceptance of trans people, because trans people and their allies want to be accepted and treated equally.

&gt;But really what’s the argument? Is a boy and male/ girl and a female synonymous. Maybe boy/girl is a social construct and maybe male/ female is just classification on reproductive organs. But let’s face it we are getting to a point where we are denying common sense and literal facts backed by scientific evidence. 

What ""scientific evidence"" do you have that there is no difference between sex and gender?

&gt;But your argument is which side is more “toxic” left or right. And the toxic side is whatever side is telling the other what they “have” to do. 

You mean like the right wing politicians passing laws banning trans people from seeking gender affirming care, or from certain public spaces?  I agree that is pretty toxic.

&gt;Like there’s some fringe extremists but really the average person doesn’t care if Timmy becomes Tina or Sara likes wearing mens clothes or even if Frank wears a dress and lipstick on the weekends. 

If the average person doesn't care why does the right wing make such a huge deal about it and try to pass laws against it?

&gt;It’s when you throw it in the average persons face and tell them it’s “Normal” even though we ALL know none of us are doing it. Making it the opposite of normal. 

What is normal?  What does that mean, to you?

&gt;If people suffering with gender dysphoria are not feeling accepted then that should be addressed and explained. But MAKING people do something or forcing them to accept is wrong. Now I don’t mean accepting trans people is wrong. I’m saying anytime you resort to “I’ll Make you” you’ve overstepped.

Do you feel the same way about the acceptance of other groups? Like, would you tell black people during the civil Rights era that it's totally fine for them to seek acceptance and equal treatment, but they shouldn't be able to *demand* it and MAKE people accept them or treat them equally?

---


&gt;Acceptance of what? 

Their identities and their dignity and worth as people.

&gt;by who?.

People who do not currently accept them, such as right wing bigots and TERFs.

&gt; And as equal as who?

Treated equal to other humans under the law.


&gt;Don’t twist shit. There’s scientific unquestionable evidence there’s a difference between people born with different reproductive organ’s. Do you disagree? Or is the physical make up of a person born with a penis the same as someone born with a vagina?


Of course there's a difference between people born with different reproductive organs, but there are also differences between people born with the same reproductive organs.




&gt;What laws? Is the law banning them Pershing them or banning taxes paying for them. Big difference. 

Like Greg Abbott's executive order instructing Texas child protective services to investigate any reported instance of a minor undergoing gender affirming care as child abuse.  As an example. 

&gt;What spaces? You mean bathrooms that don’t correspond with properly anatomically? Yeah shocker! Dicks piss in one room vaginas in another.  Not complicated. 

So you have no problem with post-transition trans people using the bathroom corresponding to their gender?  Also how would you even enforce a bathroom bill like that?  Have a bouncer at every public restroom checking genitals?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;Is this where you try and reinterpret words?
&gt;
&gt;Normal ( dictionary version)-
&gt;
&gt;- adj. conforming to a standard; usual, typical, or expected.
&gt;- Verb. the usual, average, or typical state or condition.
&gt;
&gt;So how many trans people are there? Are they the majority are they the NORM?

I find trans people to be quite average and expected, even if they are statistically a small minority.

&gt;If we don’t do any of that is it a fair comparison?

From a logical standpoint, yes.  I'm just pointing out that the idea that we can't ""force"" people to accept others isn't really an argument against policy protecting trans people.

&gt;So I asked who and you replied with generic hand waving.

ihklimc,leise_Mann,"I'm not exactly going to go through this in order, so apologies in that regard.

&gt;Over many decades, the right fought hard to make abortion illegal and they won in the end.

As it stands now, abortion is not illegal in the United States. It has been devolved to the states which, arguably, is the best decision for such a contentious issue. The issue purely comes down to personal philosophy - is a fetus a human being? If it is, then it has an overriding right to life. If not, then regulating/forbidding abortion is infringing on a woman's right to medical care. How the issue is framed instantly tells us how one feels about the topic. As polling stands, around twenty percent of Americans want abortion illegal across the board, fifty percent want a hybrid approach, and thirty-five percent want it available in all circumstances. If either of the radical approaches were pursued, then anywhere from eighty to sixty-five percent of Americans would be unsatisfied. The option which leaves the least amount of people unhappy is devolving the matter regionally.

So I wouldn't say this isn't collectivistic. From a conservative perspective, it's solidarity with the unborn who cannot advocate for themselves.

&gt;When it comes to any contentious issues, it seems the right will make the situation worse with their decisions.

I understand you are coming at this from a North American perspective, where the right is typically seen as more individualistic. But this is not the norm, and I believe this is changing. As someone who is on the political right, I have noticed (and am glad to see) more conservatives embracing collectivist economic policies. You can see this in the Trump administration particularly. His policies ranged from increased infrastructure spending, increasing mental health facilities in schools, disqualifying wealthy individuals from Social Security, and so on. He also directly said that he hated the term ""entitlement"", as social safety net programs are more akin to the government and individual ""honoring a deal"". That deal is you pay into these programs, and you benefit if you need them.

Also, these individualistic conservative philosophies are really only unique to the Conservative Party of Canada and the Republican Party of the United States, with maybe a qualifier for the Tories in Britain. Conservatives in Europe can be categorized as two distinct groups: national conservatives and christian democrats. Both of these strands of conservatism are collectivistic in some fashion, and believe in social safety nets and collective responsibility. You can see attempts at conservative political philosophy similar to that of North America tend to be really unpopular, or stagnate as a minority (look at AfD's polling numbers, or FPÖ's recent election results). Conservatives in North America used to be like this, but began a march towards individualism around the Reagan era, and if my bets are right, that's beginning to change.",2022-07-25 05:52:37,2022-07-25 05:52:37
ihkmyon,MeatSeatTreat,"First of all, you need to get it in your mind that your idea of the future and progress is not THE idea for humanity to progress. There is more than one way to skin a cat and I think that I can safely say that both sides of politics get it wrong allot no matter the country. I am a conservative but I don't vote for the conservative party where I live (Australia) because of corruption.

Conservatives aren't a monolith and you will find that many hold ideas that you yourself would think that ""progress human society"". E.g. I believe in public healthcare. It can go the other way too. In general the left side of politics here is anti illegal immigration in comparison to the US.

But I think the main problem is that you've got it in your head that the left has a monopoly on the future and progress and that progress is defacto positive. Progress isn't always what is needed. When the two sides are functioning properly the right should be holding back the new and innovative ideas of the left until an acceptable compromise is found. Also the ideas, practises and traditions of the past have utility of their own, and should not be simply brushed aside for the exigencies of ""progress"". The fundamental flaws is that these progressive ideas don't always work and can have disastrous consequences for nation states. Keep in mind, this really only applies to a functioning democracy, I don't believe the US can be described as that, the two sides are simply too entrenched in their positions to react to any threat from a third party by innovating. There's no reason to improve themselves. You either stand in one camp or the other, the rest is nothing. That's not how it should work. 

So it's not that conservatives are trying to stop progress. They are necessary to stop the endless reinvention and innovation that could prove completely disastrous to a society. They also often hold the view, that the way things have been done up until now have been atleast partially or mostly a success, thus we should continue to do them, instead of doing new unknown things.  I'm not going to argue about fiscal responsibility because despite what conservatives or liberals might tell you, both parties in office regardless of country spend like drunken sailors and the west's balance sheet is basically unpayable at this point because of it.

This is usually difficult for people within the in-group to see properly. For example, when I was in middle school, I had shared with some friends that I was an atheist. Most of the folks in my hometown are Christians, so when some of my peers heard that, they wanted to try to save me. They weren’t “rude” about it, but as an inherent cultural difference, I personally take attempts to “save me” as insulting.

The fact is that a lot of people have not-so-great opinions about religious people and religions because of personal experiences they’ve had. My public high school fought same sex prom dates and only dropped it after the second time they got sued by the ACLU. I had a college acquaintance who had a shit time in her small town schools because she’s a lesbian and wasn’t religious. She was basically treated like a harlot because she wasn’t sufficiently in line with God. She even got the chance deal with her school failing to address sexual harassment because they basically blamed her for some dude’s actions. I’ve had randos feel the need to tell me and my boyfriend that God doesn’t approve of us in some shape or fashion.

So what I want you to consider is that maybe your community was good, but you should not speak for communities you’re not part of. You may know your religious community where you grew up, but folks from the same religion in a different town could be the very people you want to separate yourself from. Additionally, maybe your community didn’t serve some folks in out-groups as much as you think they did (not saying this is the case, but I’m giving you food for thought).",2022-07-25 07:19:05,2022-07-25 07:19:05

My wife and I looked into foster/adoption in the late 2000's. Based on a supreme court decision made last year, if we apply to a Christian run foster agency that is acting under government contract to our city, they can turn us away as ""unfit"" for simply being a different religion. Nevermind that the child we may be interested in can be of our religion since again, they are acting on behalf of the city. Fun little factoid I learned while my wife and I were looking from a friend that more successfully navigate the system. There are currently \~400k kids in foster care, there are approximately \~380k churches in the US. If one family from every church took a kid or family out of the foster system, we would have no kids in foster.

Unless/until churches welcome everyone, report their own for their crimes rather than trying to protect those who committed them, and truly practice what they preach, then individual places of worship may be good for their communities, but as a whole may be either positive or negative for their community depending how many and what type exist within a given area.",2022-07-25 07:34:13,2022-07-25 07:34:13
ihkzokm,MontiBurns,"Just like all organizations, there are good examples and bad examples.  I also grew up going to Catholic church, and i felt the same way.  A generally positive, supportive and accepting community.

I think the issue is that not all churches fulfill the same role.  Mega churches don't always offer that unconditional support.

There was [a segment on the This American Life podcast](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/756/but-i-did-everything-right) about a woman who had 2 unviable pregnancies.  For the first, pregnancy, her conservative megachurch was very supportive of her and gave her a platform to speak.  On the second one, she was kind of shut out.  

&gt;""I did, many times, reach out to our church and say, hey, Sanctity of Life Sunday is coming up. I would be happy to speak out, and this is my story. And I sent that to our head pastor and many of the other pastors, and it was never brought up or answered. It was just amazing to me that I had been through this twice. I could go up there and speak about it. And I was in the church. I was a member of the church, and they never asked me to.""

&gt;Rebecca believes she wasn't given a chance to speak because only a certain kind of woman gets featured at Sanctity of Life Sunday, the woman who chose life, sometimes against doctor's advice, and certainly against all odds, and God rewarded her for her faith.

&gt;She was given some heart-wrenching diagnosis, but her baby was born completely fine. Or as she was told her son would have severe disabilities, but here he is at church, thriving as an adult. With Cora, Rebecca easily fit into this archetype. Her church community rallied around her with their prayers and their presence. And she did get her redemption story in a way, with Lydia arriving so soon after Cora's death, and Aben's adoption not too long after that. But now, Rebecca felt like her life no longer fit a clean redemption storyline.

&gt;""I can't imagine going up there at the front of the church saying, this is what happened, and then my baby died. And then it was really hard, and I was really depressed and mad at God. They didn't want to be told that it was hard. They wanted to hear me, when I was with Cora saying, I had hope, and I was OK. But I think my grief after Layla was way more authentic than it was after Cora. And people felt uncomfortable about that.""

ihlpvu1,TheGuyWithTheBalloon,"This individual didn't take such a position. He took a position with a company that has a policy to let others handle transactions if you're uncomfortable with doing them yourself. In this particular instance, it sound like the clerk was being a jerk to the customer about it, and I agree he should be reprimanded for such behavior, but we're no longer talking about the same thing.

My wife is a nurse and regularly has this sort of thing come up at work when she gets orders to remove someone from life support. As far as our religion is concerned, that's murder and she won't do it, but she doesn't impede the doctor's orders. She just finds another nurse and trades tasks with her. As best I'm aware, she's played it casual enough that no one has actually caught on to the fact that this is something she doesn't do.

---

How? If the clerk hadn't been a jerk about it, and had instead simply excused himself for a moment to go get his manger to ring up the transaction, what would have been the burden? A few extra seconds in line for the customer? That's not a big deal at all. That's a fairly reasonable compromise that allows both the clerk and the customer to get what then need.

---

Again, how? This isn't even a law. It's a company policy that lets duties be shuffled as necessary so that people are comfortable with their jobs. Presumably, the manager should also know who has what restrictions and if there is a significant number of people with restrictions should be careful to make sure that shifts are assigned in a way that all duties can be managed by someone present.

---

I'm going to copy the comment I just wrote elsewhere in this thread.

&gt;We're talking about a job where there was an existing policy.  
&gt;  
&gt;My wife is a nurse. While in college at the #1 nursing school in our country, she also decided that she was going to become more religious. (She also graduated magna cum laude.) Every nursing job she's had has had it written into her contract that she doesn't work on shabbos or Jewish holidays and cannot be scheduled for shifts on those days.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hospitals generally have policies about how many weekend shifts a nurse needs to work. At the first hospital she worked at, she just had to work every Sunday in order to make the policy work. At her current job, there aren't enough Sundays for her to fill the policy, so they wrote in her contract that Mondays also count for her as weekend shifts (since Mondays are generally a high census day for them).  
&gt;  
&gt;They aren't forced to accommodate her. There are hospitals with union rules that say everyone has to work Saturdays and so she didn't apply to those hospitals. The hospitals she has worked for have felt there is value in allowing certain accommodations in order to get the employees they want.  
&gt;  
&gt;I've similarly found myself in a role with some on call time. The company liked me while I was interviewing and decided we could work out a different on call schedule than the one they had been using previously. Again, they thought it was worth it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here too, Walgreens has a policy in place to accommodate people, because Walgreens thinks it's worthwhile for them to do that. Yes, the clerk was a jerk to the customer, and that's its own issue, but had he simply excused himself politely to go grab a manger, this wouldn't have made the news and no one would have cared.

What law would you actually like to have in place here? Are you looking to restrict the accommodations that companies can make for their employees? The fact that my wife and I are religious Jews in America shouldn't force us out of working basic careers. Yes, there are certain professions people with certain beliefs should probably avoid, but we're talking about someone who can and is happy to perform 99% of the regular tasks associated with a job. I'm not going to go get a cook job at a non-kosher restaurant and complain that I won't cook milk and meat together. If a company thinks they're worth it, why shouldn't we let them make accommodations for that 1%?

---

You keep saying that, but you haven't actually said how. What's it to you if my wife has a different schedule? No one ever wants to work Mondays because they're awful, and she's happy to do it. As a patient, you really shouldn't know the nurses in the ER, so I can't imagine you have a preference between them. Her coworkers are happy, she's happy, and her management is happy. This isn't US policy. It's a particular company making accommodation for individuals as needed. We're very clearly a minority here (and a historically oppressed one at that) and you'd rather have a system where we can't find jobs because you wont let companies make their own decisions about their internal policies? Again, what law would you like there to be here? You've still yet to say.

---

There *is* an absence of laws for the most part. We have been talking about policies of private companies that you don't like. It sounds like you want to restrict these companies'ability to make these policies. Have I misunderstood you?

---

Okay, so to be clear, you'd like to amend Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to exclude religion as a protected class when it comes to employment?

ihlwzkk,pgold05,"&gt; I don't ""feel like"" a man

Hello, I am transgender and this question comes up literally all the time. cis people have trouble understanding gender identity because they don't feel it, but of course you are not going to notice it because your gender identity matches your sex. It all just feels normal and makes sence, and it's all you have ever known, so of course feeling your gender is just not something that is going to happen. 

Lets think about this another way than, have you heard of BID? 

https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/07/health/body-integrity-dysphoria-wellness/index.html

People with BID feel as if one of thier limbs is not part of thier body. They will try to cut it off, it is often fatal if not treated in some way as they attempt to self amputate. 

Do we ""feel"" like we are supposed to have two arms? Not really, it just seems like the natural state of things, but that does not mean that feeling does not exist, obviously they are some people who don't feel the same about thier body, that having 2 arms or two legs gives them extreme distress, perhaps the same thing any one of us would feel is we woke up tomorrow with a third arm grafted on our abdomen. 

The brain expects the body to look and feel a certain way. If there is a mismatch, it causes distress.

https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2019/11/14/1912636116.full.pdf

If the brain is expecting a person to be a woman, and they have male parts and hormones, it causes distress. If the brain is expecting one arm and the person has 2, it causes distress, ect. 

----------

The fact of the matter is, if you take a cis person, such as yourself, and start giving them HRT (in your case, estrogen) they **will** begin to experience dysphoria. It's not like you will suddenly become mentally ill, its just how the brain reacts to the wrong hormones. You have a brain expecting a male body/hormones, or to put it more succinctly, a male gender identity. Anyone can try it if they really wanted too, though the [few cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) where cis people were forced to transition did not end well, so I do not recommend it.   

Dysphoria is not a mental illness or defect, its simply a mismatch between what the brain is expecting and what the body/hormones' are. It's biology and the science [backs that up](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6677266/).

----------

EDIT: This post got some traction so I am going to address the most common questions people are asking me.

**Based on what you say, isn't being transgender a defect?**: Humans have a certain variety to them, we accept as a society that some humans will be born gay, nearsighted, a dwarf, or deaf, ect. We do not call these people defective because every single person born would be considered defective in some manner. We accept the messiness of human physiology in all other aspects so it would be extremely disingenuous to claim being born transgender was a *defect*.

**Based on what you say, isn't being transgender a mental illness?**: As far as I know, the umbrella of mental disorders usually revolves around things we treat via therapy. Technically a million things could be conserved a mental illness, like being [hangry](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/07/07/hangry-research-angry-hungry/7825022001/) or [women with PCOS](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/18/6/638/627838) but we usually **reserve the term for things that require therapy as part of treatment**. Those who have gender dysphoria very well may seek therapy to deal with the associated difficulty of living with the condition, but only **transition will ultimately treat GD, therapy will not.**

---

&gt; The treatment for BID is to tell those people that they should live with all their limbs.

That is incorrect, there is no accepted treatment for BID and the only method that has improved thier lives in amputation. Therapy and antidepressants have no effect.

You just insist on calling it 'gender dysphoria' and labeling it as a mental illness. We're talking about the exact same thing, just with different language.

I do object to the idea that being trans per se is a mental illness, though. I think it doesn't fit smoothly into either physical or mental illness as a category, since neither the brain nor the body is broken. They're just not compatible.

&gt; I don't ""feel like"" a man, I just am one because I was born with XY chromosomes. 

I was also born with XY chromosomes, and I hated being a man and desperately wanted to be a woman. My experience is different from yours.

&gt; The new definition for woman and man as ""anyone who identifies as a woman/man"" is ridiculous. It is very obviously circular, and I've seen many intelligent people make themselves look like idiots trying to justify it. ""Adult male/female human"" is a perfectly good definition. If more inclusive language is desired you can use ""men and trans-men"" or ""women and trans-women"" as necessary.

""Women"" includes me. ""Women and trans-women"" implies that it does not.

What's the problem with ""woman"" as inclusive and ""cis woman"" or ""trans woman"" in the rare contexts in which the distinction is relevant?

&gt; [from comments]  To me that suggests that, for example a trans-man was born a woman with a more masculine brain structure.

There is good, though not ironclad, evidence to suggest that this is the case:

* Trans status is heavily correlated with conditions that create hormone abnormalities in the womb, but
* is *not*, conditional on that, correlated with hormone levels as an adult
* There are strong genetic factors, with twins of trans people orders of magnitude more likely than the general public to be trans
* Markers of prenatal hormone exposure, like digit ratio, correlate strongly with trans status. (My digit ratio, for example, would be three-something standard deviations out of the male range.)
* The David Reimer case shows, at least anecdotally, that if you raise a physiologically normal boy as a girl, you see behavior patterns very similar to those shown by trans men.
* Direct studies of trans peoples' brains find patterns typical of their identified, not birth, sex, at least in some respects
* SNPs that screw with testosterone receptors are strongly correlated with being a trans woman
* Complete androgen insensitivity, which causes the body to be unreceptive to testosterone, almost invariably results in a female gender identity (exceptions exist but they are extremely rare)
* PCOS is strongly correlated with being a trans man
* and when you mess with hormones at specific points in fetal development in rats, you get male rats with female behavioral patterns and vice-versa

None of this is definitive, but in conjunction with other data on trans people, it's certainly *really* suggestive. And in particular, it suggests that gender identity has some underlying neurological ""flag"".

You should read your own link, because page 4 has a big ol' header that says:

&gt; Being Transsexual, Transgender, or Gender Nonconforming
Is a Matter of Diversity, Not Pathology

They go on to say:

&gt; **Some** people experience gender dysphoria at such a level that the distress meets criteria for formal diagnosis that might be classified as a mental disorder. [...] A disorder is a description of something with which a person might struggle, not a description of the person or the person’s identity. [...] **Thus, transsexual, transgender, and gender nonconforming individuals are not inherently disordered.** Rather, the distress of gender dysphoria, when present, is the concern that might be diagnosable and for which various treatment options are available.

The diagnosed condition is the distress, not the gender identity. A trans person post-transition, like myself, no longer feels the distress (and thus no longer meets diagnostic criteria of any sort) but is still trans.

---

I felt more excited by the idea of being a woman than distressed about the idea of being a man, for what it's worth. But even setting that aside, this is like saying ""how can you know someone's poking a sharp object into your back without experiencing pain"". Yes, dysphoria tells you you're trans, but it's not the *same thing as* being trans.

And, as noted, a post-transition trans person is no longer dysphoric but is still trans.

---

&gt; I'm confused by the ""sharp object in the back"" analogy though because that would cause pain, which is how I would know it is there.

Right. But the sharp object is still not the pain. The *sensation or sign* of the thing is not the thing itself, is what I mean.

It depends on precisely what you mean by 'dysphoria'. Do you simply mean ""without a desire to have the physiology of the other sex""? Or do you mean ""without rising to the level of the diagnostic criteria of Gender Dysphoria, the condition""?

If so, I - at least according to one doctor - am an example of the latter. I was denied care for not being distressed *enough* about my body at the time.

---

Well, one, transition != surgery. I haven't had (and might never have, depending on how my sexual partners shake out) genital surgery. I'd certainly swap if I could snap my fingers, but that shit is scary and expensive and it can't give me the thing I'd most care about anyway (the ability to carry children).

But anyway. By the definition you give, certainly most trans people are dysphoric. I don't know if all of them are. It doesn't seem totally implausible to me that someone could feel just the positive stuff and not the negative, I guess? I don't know that it really matters that much, and I'd rather err on the side of being accepting in cases where I think there's a strong bias toward not.

I certainly wasn't very dysphoric relative to the average trans person, in that it wasn't like I couldn't look at my body in the mirror or anything. It was just a bummer and I was so happy to see it change.

But if any discomfort is sufficient to classify it as a mental illness in your mind - well, why do people do *anything* except discomfort with the current state and desire for a different one? What makes transitioning any different?",2022-07-25 10:48:51,2022-07-25 16:37:06

ihnd70o,laconicflow,"I agree with you on number three. The democrats are listening to their most radical voices on cultural and social issues, and so they say silly inanities like ""pregnant men,"" and lose votes from the right of that position. That overreach on social issues is allowing  Republicans to paint democrats as being radical on social issues, as though the most radical left-wing opinions  is the stance of the democratic party, which it isn't. 

I disagree with you on No. 2. Abortion rights  have a majority of support in all the polling I've seen. The support isn't for totally unrestricted abortion, but, abortion with some limits on it is the majority position, Abortion only in cases of rape and incest is not the majority position. 

A democrat in a red area may benifit from being pro-life, but it depends on where that person is running, so as a local tactic, I agree, but as a matter of national policy the party should stay pro choice, my bet is the abortion issue is a good one for democrats going into November and beyond.

  
I half agree with you on number I. Tellig people that they supported Nazi's last election is not the way to get them to vote for you. On the other hand, Trump attempted a coup, and, to me acted as a wanabee authoritarian, we have the courage of men and women and the sgtrength of our constitution to thank for his coup attempt failing. Also, moderate Republicans are sort of an endangered species, and the left heaps praise upon them these days. 

In my opinion a large part of the Republican party is playing footsy with a movement that is anti-democratic, and I don't mean democeratic party, I mean anti-democracy, which is very bad, and the democrats and the moderate Republicans should say that, because not saying it when it is true is enabling it. 

The issue is that, as a party you have to say things to keep the people who voted for you last time, and to get more people next time, and its a narrow road to walk.


I would also say that a lot of this has to do with where you run. Stuff that seems overly liberal to you and me will play well in very liberal area's.

---

I don’t think the consequences of this are what you think. For one, the line isn’t drawn very clearly in that type of polling, so we don’t know exactly what we’re capturing. Further, not all democratic candidate support abortion without restriction. Generally, the party positions come down to the hazy concepts of pro-choice vs pro-life, without the exact definitions clearly defined. Most Americans identify as pro-choice, and there is very little evidence that Americans who identify as pro-choice but still support some limitations on abortion (say, late term) are voting Republican based on this issue, especially since the loudest Republican positions are often that of full abortion prohibition. 

But I think the most important thing you’re failing to appreciate is that only about half of Americans vote, and that’s looking a presidential elections. The percentage who vote in other elections is lower. And in an environment like that, you don’t win by finding the center, you win by animating groups of voters who will turn out.

Right now, the US is experiencing the highest inflation rate we've seen since the 80s, so the economy's both doing poorly and doing poorly in a very salient way; that's going to make midterms bad for democrats basically no matter what messaging they go with.

There's a fairly broad range of options on abortion policy between 'only rape, incest, and medical necessity' and 'universally'; in particular, there are a decent number of people who support abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy, but not later on.  It's probably true that Democrats can net votes by moving right on abortion, but the particular position you suggest seems farther right than necessary.",2022-07-25 18:08:43,2022-07-25 18:08:43

Secondly...how would the exception for rape or incest even work? Would you insist on a conviction before the abortion? Because it is incredibly unlikely that a person gets arrested, tried, and convicted in 9 months, especially if the victim doesn't recognize their attacker. And if you don't, well, I think you'll find the rate of rape claims with dubious evidence will skyrocket. What happens if someone gets an abortion and then it turns out to have been consensual sex? Are we going to imprison that person? What happens when we accidentally imprison a rape victim for the crime of having an abortion after being raped?

ihnvsvw,OrdinaryOk5247,"Eugenics is always a bad idea. I have objections to it on the basis that every life is worthwhile, even those touched by the ""horrible"" disabilities you refer to. Their lived are not just constant suffering, their lives are complicated and worthwhile things. Ask them about it sometime. Disabled people are often quite happy, and even if they were not, its no one else's business whether or not disabled people are allowed to exist.

Even beyond that, your idea of a ""limited"" eugenics is still a fantasy and a mistake. Enabling a hierarchical structure with the ability to decide who deserves to reproduce and who does not will invariably end in tragedy and great evil. In your soft-eugenics, who gets to decide which people get to reproduce? The government? Do you trust the government, any government, to make consistently smart and informed decisions about who lives and dies, or who gets to reproduce?

No eugenics are moral eugenics. Even if you claim you want only a limited eugenics which eliminate painful conditions, enabling any authority with the power to decide who gets to reproduce and who doesn't, who gets to exist and who doesn't, invariably ends in fascist tendencies.

What gives a bunch of able-bodied people the right and authority to decide what disabilities qualify for this? What gives you or I the right to say ""I don't think that this class of person should exist, for the protection of everyone.""? Humanity is not exactly struggling-- there are 7 Billion of us. We have no need to only invest all of our resources into the ""strongest"" as determined by a bunch of folks on reddit. 

Okay, so really quick, lets talk about Buck v. Bell. [Buck v. Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_v._Bell) was the SCOTUS case in the 1927 where the forced sterilization of the ""feeble minded"" was permitted. This case has never been overturned. In the case, Carrie Buck was ordered sterilized for being ""mentally feeble."" As it turns out, Nuck had actually been institutionalized to cover up her rape at the hands of her adopted mother's nephew. She was never mentally feeble at all. SCOTUS still upheld her sterilization for the ""health and safety of the nation."" One by one, all the states repealed their laws that allowed for such sterilizations. Nazis, however, cited Buck v. Bell in their defense at the Nuremberg Trials.

If you allow any eugenics, you are creating thousands of Carrie Bucks at a minimum. Many, many people will be wrongfully harmed, not just because eugenics is wrong, but because governments are *really* bad at getting it right. For example, roughly 4-6% of American prisoners are believed to be innocent. If our justice system can accidentally and wrongfully limit the right of liberty for 1 in 20 people, what makes you think that we'll be any more competent at limiting the right of reproduction?",2022-07-25 19:17:16,2022-07-25 19:17:16

ihoktz3,StoicInTheCentre,"Australian here. As a disclaimer, I 100% sympathise with you - making animals suffer to try and un-fuck a human mistake is really rough, and I wish there was another way. That being said, let's go point-by-point:

&gt;...read that neuter/spaying cats then releasing them isn’t a good option because they can still kill birds after they’re released. So, why don’t they simply not release the cats?  
&gt;  
&gt;My first idea: they build huge enclosures (almost like a zoo) where the cats can live the rest of their days out in peace (while not hurting birds). The Australian government might even make some money doing this. Because I would assuming having a cat zoo would bring in a lot of visitors. Additionally, they could make it where people can adopt the cats. Imagine all the international tourists who go to the cat zoo while visiting Australia, fall in love with a cat, and take it back home.

You've already acknowledged that the idea is a stretch, but I want to impress upon you just how much of a stretch it is to keep all the animals alive, fed and accommodated somewhere while you wait for them to die a natural death. According to the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, The Environment and Water (DCCEEW), there are 2.1 - 6.3 **million** feral cats in Australia. Just think about that number for a moment. How would you go about accommodating them? Cats are solitary predators - dominant male cats may have territories of up to 8 km2, while the territories of females are smaller and may even be halved while kittens are being reared. If you're goal is to be humane, I assume you wouldn't want to pack them in like factory-farmed animals, so where do we even get the space? Much less the food, water, veterinary staff, support staff, etc.? I think we can agree that this is not a feasible option, so let's move to:

&gt;Potentially they could send the cats to other countries, or declaw the cats, or build enclosures to protect the birds?

Again, according to DCCEEW:

&gt;Feral cats threaten the survival of over 100 native species in Australia. They have caused the extinction of some ground-dwelling birds and small to medium-sized mammals. They are a major cause of decline for many land-based endangered animals such as the bilby, bandicoot, bettong and numbat.

And this article from the Smithsonian [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/australias-cats-kill-two-billion-animals-annually-180977235/](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/australias-cats-kill-two-billion-animals-annually-180977235/) leads with:

&gt;Australia’s Cats Kill Two Billion Animals Annually

There is no stopping these creatures. They are the perfect predator in Australia, with it's lack of large predatory mammals and preponderance of endangered, small marsupials, it's almost like they're purpose-built to cause mass-extinctions.

I don't like the method any more than you do. But at this stage, it's a necessary evil.

Edit: The DCCEEW actually has a pretty comprehensive resource on the topic, which goes in to far more detail than I ever could. Here's the link: [https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/invasive-species/feral-animals-australia/feral-cats#:\~:text=Feral%20cats%20are%20the%20same,grasslands%2C%20wetlands%20and%20arid%20areas](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/invasive-species/feral-animals-australia/feral-cats#:~:text=Feral%20cats%20are%20the%20same,grasslands%2C%20wetlands%20and%20arid%20areas).",2022-07-25 23:08:30,2022-07-25 23:08:30

Plenty of trans women have a penis. Especially with bottom surgery is so inaccessible (there are also plenty of trans women that have a penis by choice). 

One of the main reasons trans women find the word and the overall genre offensive is because there is no representation of trans women in its, it’s not “futa” and then “trans women” it’s just futa, this opens up a world where it’s easier to see trans women as just “futa”. 

We also still are in a society where trans women are drastically shamed and discriminated against in dating especially if they have a penis becuse “they can’t be a women with a penis” this porn  genre is a reminder and breeding ground of this mentality.",2022-07-26 01:37:13,2022-07-26 01:49:49
ihoy39f,DouglerK,"Futanari is arguably fetishization. Hentai is full of fetishes.

I'm not sure what crowds you roll with where talking about other hentai fetishes don't offend people but ""futa"" or futanari does. 

Basically the times where it is not going to be offensive is actually quite exceptional. You said yourself you wouldn't say it in the company of those who find it offensive. That would be 99% of the time with everyone except certain individuals. Hentai in general is going to be an offensive topic most of the time. 

Even with just the word in particular. The fact that you recognize that you need to be discretionary with the use of the word means that it's offensive enough to warrant that discretion. A word being offensive really comes down to how many people actually find it offensive and how often it's use actually affects them. The latter might not be so relevant here but for the former even you acknowledge there are enough people who do find it offensive to warrant discrection. 

So if you're talking to other people about your fetishes who also don't find futa to be offensive then go ahead and say it. You couldn't be stopped. Nobody would even know. Any offensive word can be said i secret or away from the people it offends.

 It is also specifically a porn term. If you aren't having a porn conversation then it would be quote offensive to describe someone or something in porn terms.

Also just a second much less complicated thought. Futa is short for Futanari. Tranny is short for transexual. Tranny is pretty offensive. Transsexual is not so offensive. You think something similar is going on with ""Futa"" and the specific relationship to fetish material being the worst representation of it? Futanari is ""dual form"" and androgyny and hermaphroditism. ""Futa"" is a porn fetish. 

Similarly hermaphrodite is a politically incorrect word to use sometimes. Hermaphrositism is a specific disorder. In (especially hentai) porn the subjects are made up. Artists can draw them as whatever their fetish wants them to be. They are some kind of fetishized ideal. They aren't real people. In reality people are much more complicated. Hermaphroditism as depicted in porn is rare compared to what real people with intersection conditions deal with. Using hermaphrodite as a catcheall is quite inconsiderate of the reality most intersex individuals face.",2022-07-26 02:01:23,2022-07-26 02:01:23

It is more frequently used as a pornographic sorting/genre tag for when Japanese illustrated pornography contains one or more characters that present as women and have some set of male sex organs. Weebs and other online-populations then take this term and start applying it to real trans people.

This is sexualizing, fetishizing, and objectifying trans people, which is what makes the word offensive. You seem to already understand this, so what you are missing is just that words are not intrinsically meaningful in and of themselves.",2022-07-26 02:09:30,2022-07-26 02:09:30
ihp1r1b,iloomynazi,"How often do you check a persons genitals, chromosomes or biology before you refer to them as a man or a woman or use he/she? The answer is zero. ""Man"" and ""woman"" have \*never\* meant biology, it's not a redefinition of the term. 

So what is it? It's a relationship of social roles (which yes are tied to biology e.g. motherhood), how someone sees themselves in that society, and how society sees them. 

If you were meeting a trans woman for a date and she arrives before you, you would ask the waiter ""I am here to meet the woman in the yellow jacket"". You would not say ""I am here to meet the man in the yellow jacket"" because the waiter would turn around and say ""there is no man here wearing a yellow jacket"". You have confused the situation by referring to biology rather than gender. 

So at what point does biology play a part here? Its probably useful information for their doctor. But if someone looks like woman, sees themself as a woman, society sees them as a woman (e.g. being catcalled in the street)... then what is the point of calling them a man? 

We use words, nouns in particular, to communicate to eachother what to expect. I use the word apple, and you imagine a small green fruit. If I use the word woman... what comes to mind? How far does a trans person fit what you expect from a woman in a social experience?

In short, trans people know that they cannot change their biology on a fundamental level to match the opposite sex. The argument is that gender is so much more than biology, it actually becomes \*incorrect\* to refer to a trans woman as a man, or a trans man as a woman. 

Also I would recommend spending some time around trans people, or even just watching their content on youtube. Once you meet/experience trans people it becomes undeniable that they are who they say they are. As a Contrapoints fan I watched her before she transitioned, and its incredible how you brain just switches, and your perception changes to understand that they simply are their gender.

ihrk72n,cyronius,"&gt;I do not consider post-transition trans people who are no longer experiencing dysphoria to be mentally ill.

So if you don't believe they're mentally ill, and also don't believe in gender identity, from your perspective, what exactly makes a post transition transgender person trans?

---

Under that definition, a drag queen is transgender

A man wearing a dress is transgender.

I'm trans. These things are of no interest to me. I'm still trans though, because my identity does not arise from this context

---

&gt;with the understanding that they are still their birth gender

Isn't this part gender identity though?

---

So, I'm a trans person, and my gender presentation isn't related to my dysphoria in any way. It makes a difference to how I move in society, but it does absolutely nothing for me or my own personal experiences.

How does that fit in?

---

I'm saying that I have no innate sense of my expression being related to my gender. I present pragmatically in line with my gender, but only because it reduces social friction.

Before I transitioned, I presented as the gender people assumed me to be, and I had no interest in ""cross dressing"" etc.  I have no stories of secretly trying on my siblings/parents clothes and I am genuinely confused as to how or why clothing and makeup has meaning to other peoples experiences of their own gender.

I wore makeup and dresses etc early in transition, because doing so helped me get gendered correctly. Now that I ""cis pass"" though, I get gendered correctly whatever I wear, so I've stopped caring what I wear. You're just as likely to find me in jeans as a dress.  If I could get away with tshirt and shorts at work, that's pretty much all I'd wear.  I don't do makeup, I don't do my nails, and I don't even have my ears pierced.  

I struggled with dysphoria my whole life until I transitioned, but non of my dysphoria was related to my presentation. It was related to my body and my identity.  I needed to get my body in line with how it should be, and I spent a good deal of time doing that.  But that's not all it was.  I also struggled with being seen as a man and assumed to be a man, and I did whatever I had to do to fix that.  Presentation was part of that only for as long as it had to be

---

Not being read as a man fixed my dysphoria. That and bringing my body in to alignment with my internal sense of what it should be.

To call that presentation though is to misrepresent my experience.  Presentation is a performance, it's something that you have to actively do. That's the part that I have no interest in.

I haven't changed how I act, I don't actively ""do"" anything. Now, I can just exist *without a performance* and without dysphoria.

So here's a way of putting it. Aside from bottom surgery to fix the genitals I was unhappy with (and which no one else sees anyway) if I could have transitioned by having everyone genuinely see me as a woman without me having to do anything, without having to change my body, without having to change my presentation, *I'd have done that.*",2022-07-25 15:17:18,2022-07-26 13:55:48

&gt; This is my point. They believe they are asexual but are not. 

Okay, and how do you know this with any certainty?

And if their libido comes back later...so what? No harm done.

&gt; When the asexuality thing is a clear asset of this concept, it has to be true to some degree.

I don't think you can be confident that it is, though.

&gt; Being given a pill that temporarily numbs a condition and that if you abandon it makes the condition worse in principle advances the condition. It being called a 'treatment' is just another way that it's misleading.

I mean, even if depression weren't self-reinforcing (which it is), we absolutely do treat symptoms of many illnesses just to help people feel better. And since not being in pain really helps with being able to take action, it's not just to feel better, either.

As an example, when I had surgery, I was told I needed to get up and move around frequently to ensure it healed properly. They also gave me painkillers so it wouldn't hurt like all hell to do that. The painkillers contributed to my ability to try to heal properly, just like antidepressants help a depressed person to get enough energy to start doing the things they need to do to break the cycle.

&gt; High estrogen equals lowered test. And low test has strong 'depressant' effects that can outweigh oestrogen's weak antidepressant effects.

Not in a trans woman, it doesn't.

&gt; Is it profitable for the producers and suppliers? Does it make some people dependent on it? I don't see why it's not so plausible a thought.

This would require an absolutely massive conspiracy full of people who aren't financially motivated. Even if they *were* financially motivated, most people don't spend years going into a field to try to help people just to make a quick buck exploiting them. Yes, there are exceptions, but your theory would require virtually everyone in the entire field to be evil.

Like, why is it easier for you to believe in a conspiracy of thousands of people than to believe that, you know, you're wrong about what treatments work in an area where you have no expertise?

&gt; That's good for you, but the point of that wasn't to be a denunciation of the trans identity, but rather the expose what I believe is misleading about the whole process, the treatment of the whole thing.

And what is it you think is misleading?

&gt; Not necessarily and not all the time. Loneliness can be a cause of depression, and that's not even somewhat biological.

Depression is a state of your brain. Whether that state is initially created by external circumstances (as it was in my case) or not doesn't make it any less of an internal problem. The proximate trigger for my depression was being super poor, but it didn't go away just because I stopped being poor - I kept having the same thoughts and same struggles even after the initial cause was gone.

Or, to put it another way: smoking causes lung cancer, but that doesn't mean you can just stop smoking and your cancer will be cured. The cancer is a new, self-sustained thing that exists independently of the smoking. Your claims here are something like ""um, chemo isn't addressing the root cause"" - no, but it's addressing the problem right now.

&gt; It would be a decent proposition in my opinion to suggest that not only is the depression caused by greater disorders, but also malnutrition.

ihsihpe,Bamboozle_,"The DOJ report was from 2004 and before the non-renewal of the ban.  15+ years of new data since the ban has been lifted should be taken into account.  The report was also not produced by the DOJ but was summitted to the DOJ by the Jerry Lee Center of Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania authored by Christopher S. Koper with help from Daniel J. Woods and Jeffrey A. Roth.   From the 2004 report's recommendations:

&gt; The effects of the AW-LCM ban have yet to be fully realized; therefore, we
recommend continued study of trends in the availability and criminal use of AWs and
LCMs. Even if the ban is lifted, longer-term study of crimes with AWs and LCMs will
inform future assessment of the consequences of these policy shifts and improve
understanding of the responses of gun markets to gun legislation more generally. [pg 98]

&gt; **As better data on LCM use become available, more research is warranted on the
impacts of AW and LCM trends (which may go up or down depending on the ban’s fate)
on gun murders and shootings, as well as levels of death and injury per gun crime.**
Indicators of the latter, such as victims per gunfire incident and wounds per gunshot
victim, are useful complementary outcome measures because they reflect the mechanisms
through which use of AWs and LCMs is hypothesized to affect gun deaths and
injuries. [pg 98]

Also the summary of the 2004 report states that more time would be needed to see the effects of the ban due to loop-holes left in the ban, though as you state it does comment that the ban's overall impact on gun violence would be small at best:

&gt; Although the ban has been successful in reducing crimes with AWs, any benefits
from this reduction are likely to have been outweighed by steady or rising use of nonbanned semiautomatics with LCMs, which are used in crime much more frequently than
AWs. Therefore, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in
gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and
injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes
resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury, as we might have
expected had the ban reduced crimes with both AWs and LCMs.

&gt; **However, the grandfathering provision of the AW-LCM ban guaranteed that the
effects of this law would occur only gradually over time. Those effects are still unfolding
and may not be fully felt for several years into the future, particularly if foreign, pre-ban
LCMs continue to be imported into the U.S. in large numbers. It is thus premature to
make definitive assessments of the ban’s impact on gun violence.**

&gt; **Having said this, the ban’s impact on gun violence is likely to be small at best,
and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. AWs were used in no more than 8% of
gun crimes even before the ban. Guns with LCMs are used in up to a quarter of gun
crimes, but it is not clear how often the outcomes of gun attacks depend on the ability to
fire more than 10 shots (the current limit on magazine capacity) without reloading.**

&gt; Nonetheless, reducing crimes with AWs and especially LCMs could have nontrivial effects on gunshot victimizations. As a general matter, hit rates tend to be low in
gunfire incidents, so having more shots to fire rapidly can increase the likelihood that
offenders hit their targets, and perhaps bystanders as well. While not entirely consistent,
the few available studies contrasting attacks with different types of guns and magazines
generally suggest that attacks with semiautomatics – including AWs and other
semiautomatics with LCMs – result in more shots fired, persons wounded, and wounds
per victim than do other gun attacks. Further, a study of handgun attacks in one city
found that about 3% of gunfire incidents involved more than 10 shots fired, and those
cases accounted for nearly 5% of gunshot victims. However, the evidence on these
matters is too limited (both in volume and quality) to make firm projections of the ban’s
impact, should it be reauthorized. [pgs 96-97]

Further from the 2004 reports ""Potential Consequences of Lifting the Ban"" section:

&gt; It is also possible, and perhaps probable, that new AWs and LCMs will eventually
be used to commit mass murder. Mass murders garner much media attention, particularly
when they involve AWs (Duwe, 2000). The notoriety likely to accompany mass murders
if committed with AWs and LCMs, especially after these guns and magazines have been
deregulated, could have a considerable negative impact on public perceptions, an effect
that would almost certainly be intensified if such crimes were committed by terrorists
operating in the U.S.  [pg 101]

His conclusion is thus:

&gt; In conclusion, despite numerous challenges to studying the issues addressed herein, this article highlights a few key points about the use, impacts, and regulation of high-capacity semiautomatic weapons as they pertain to the problem of mass shootings in the United States. LCM firearms are used in between 20% and 58% of all firearm mass murders, and they are used in a particularly high share of public mass shootings. Mass shootings perpetrated with LCM firearms result in substantially more fatalities and injuries than do attacks with other firearms, and these differences are particularly pronounced for nonfatal gunshot injuries. Quantifying the unique contribution of LCM firearms to these outcomes with greater precision, independently of or in interaction with offender and situational characteristics, will require further and more sophisticated study. Notwithstanding, extrapolations from available data imply that tighter regulation of high-capacity firearms could potentially reduce mass shooting fatalities by 11% to 15% and total fatal and nonfatal injuries from these attacks by one quarter, with larger impacts for public mass shootings. For reasons discussed, actual impacts from LCM regulation seem likely to be lower, although some aggregate-level studies raise the possibility of larger effects. Nonetheless, these figures are high enough to suggest that tighter regulation of high-capacity semiautomatic weaponry—and restriction of LCMs in particular—is one policy measure that can contribute meaningfully to reducing deaths and injuries from mass shootings. Effects may be modest and gradual, however, depending on the form of those regulations.

&gt; **The federal AW–LCM ban of 1994 had important exemptions and loopholes that limited its impacts in the short run. Its expiration in 2004, however, was followed by an upswing in mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics that has contributed to more severe incidents with higher fatalities and injuries.** Policy makers who wish to reinstate a new version of the federal ban should give careful consideration to any grandfathering provisions in future legislation. Assessing the political and practical difficulties of registering all AWs and LCMs or establishing turn-in or buyback programs for them is beyond the scope of this article.  Policy makers should note, however, that it may take many years to attain substantial reductions in crimes committed with banned guns and/or magazines if a new law exempts the existing stock, which has likely grown considerably since the time of the original ban. Policies regarding exemptions must also explicitly address the status of imported guns and magazines.

&gt; In the meantime, further research is needed on the implementation and effects of state restrictions on AWs and LCMs (and perhaps those at the local level as well). Although some studies indicate that mass shootings are lower in states with these laws (and LCM bans in particular), more evidence is needed to show definitively that these laws reduce crimes with LCM firearms and, in turn, reduce mass shootings and other gunshot victimizations. Further research is also needed to determine whether the effectiveness of these laws varies based on their specific provisions.

&gt; The conclusions offered here are also subject to various caveats regarding the current state of data and research on mass shootings. Better data collection systems are needed to track mass shootings and document the features of these incidents, including the type of weaponry used. There is also a need for more studies that analyze the dynamics and outcomes of attacks with different types of guns and magazines. Such studies would help to refine our understanding of how changes in the use of high-capacity semiautomatics affect the incidence and severity of mass shootings. This essay has also focused on firearm mass murders resulting in four or more deaths. As data become more widely available for tracking multiple victim shootings, studies using different definitions of mass shootings (e.g., based on total injury counts) could provide a wider perspective on how the use and regulation of LCM firearms affect mass violence. Finally, future studies will also need to further assess whether firearm restrictions, including those on AWs and LCMs, lead to substitution of other methods in attempts to inflict mass casualty events (and with what results).

&gt; In closing, restrictions on AWs and LCMs are not a complete solution for the problem of mass shootings or public mass shootings more specifically. Nonetheless, they are modest policy measures that can likely help to reduce the incidence and severity of mass shootings over time. Given the high social costs of murders and shootings these laws could produce substantial savings for society even if their effects on mass shootings are modest.

ihsw0xo,Purple171717,"I'm not quite learned enough to comment on the rest of your post, but I will say in regards to the circular definition of women that the english language is already full of such definitions. For an example I ask you, what is a sandwich? The dictionary definition would state that a sandwich is ""an item consisting of two pieces of bread with meat, cheese, or other filling between them, eaten as a light meal."" However, this definition conflicts greatly with what society at large would refer to as a sandwich. Many sandwiches are made in such a way that the pieces of bread are not cut all the way apart, so it could be argued that those are not actually sandwiches since that would technically be one piece of bread and not two. If you do decide to include these sandwiches then now you also have to include hot dogs as sandwiches because its meat between bread, thus fitting the definition of sandwich. To take it a step further, what even is bread? Looking at the definition, its ""food made of flour, water, and yeast or another leavening agent, mixed together and baked"". Using that definition tortillas certainly fall under the category of bread and thus Quesadillas fall under the category of sandwich as they contain cheese between two pieces of ""bread"". This definition of sandwich could also be said to not include many typical sandwiches, particularly the hamburger, as it says sandwiches are a light meal where it could certainly be argued that things like burgers are not light in the slightest. So really at the end of the day if you examine it even a little bit, these definitions make no sense. The only definition that truly includes all sandwiches and nothing is ""What society refers to as a sandwich"", a completely circular definition that essentially defines sandwich as a sandwich, but that is inarguably the best definition. Really the whole things boils down to something linguists have been arguing about for decades, whether language should be descriptive or prescriptive. Descriptivists would say that words don't have to be use the exact way they are defined as long as the person you are communicating with understands what you mean, whereas prescriptivists would say that language should only be used in accordance to a strict set of rules (I think anyways, I'm not a linguist myself so feel free to correct that if necessary). Anyways, in the modern day most linguists tend to be in favour of descriptive language because, as illustrated by the sandwich point, prescriptive language tends to fall apart rather quickly when looked at too hard. So it really doesn't matter if the definition of woman is ""someone who identifies as a woman"" because that is the only definition of woman which includes all women and is therefore the best definition. It doesn't matter that the definition is circular because most nouns are or should be when you look into it. Sandwich was just one example I gave but there are plenty, the definition for book includes magazines and the current definition of human is already ""a human being, especially a person as distinguished from in animal or (in science fiction) an alien"" That definition is completely circular because to be any more specific would inevitably not include some group of humans. But thats ok because we don't need a hyper specific definition for humans because we can simply understand what is and is not human, similarly to how we just understand what is and is not a sandwich, is and is not a book, and is and is not a woman. A woman is someone who identifies as a woman, and thats as specific as the definition needs to be because if someone is using the word woman you can just know that they're using it to refer to someone that it adequately describes. Similarly to how you just know what I'm talking about when I say sandwich, book, or human despite their less than specific definitions

---

You misunderstand, the point of that was not to say a hotdog is not a sandwich, it was to point out that while society at large would not casually refer to one as a sandwich it is still, likely unintentionally, included in the current definition. So currently if two people were to argue about whether or not a hot dog is a sandwich, they would both be correct just in different ways. To use the the same terms as before, one would be right based on prescriptivism, while the other would be correct based on descriptivism. Since both are perfectly valid arguments the two would never reach any sort of conclusion, thus muddling the communication process which is the exact opposite of what language as a concept strives to achieve. It is only with the more circular definition that this problem is solved. For example, lets say sandwich was defined as ""an object referred to by two or more people as a sandwich."" While still not perfect, it does now allow for both mindsets about what is and is not a sandwich to coexist. Now, a hot dog is only a sandwich if both people communicating agree that it is a sandwich, thus eliminating any confusion or hinderance to the communication process that was previously there. Society at large will likely continue to refer to the same old things as sandwiches, now without greatly reduced confusion, and small subsets can still refer to agreed upon items as sandwiches without being incorrect so long as they all understand what the others are talking about. So I continue to fail to understand what the problem is with something having a circular definition when really it acts as a great solution to many linguistic problems. It only seems like a bad idea because the human brain likes to think that everything can be sorted into neat little boxes with perfect boundaries, but the reality is that almost nothing can be put into these boxes. I mentioned previously that the current definition of Human is already circular and likely has been for awhile, and no one noticed or cared(as far as I know anyways) because it really is the best definition. There is no one defining trait shared across all humans, similarly to how there is no one defining trait between all women, men, or even sandwiches. When it comes to ideas and complex and variable as this circular definitions truly work best, as demonstrated by the definition of human. No one cared about that definition being circular, and yet for some reason the word woman or man being defined similarly is sparking a national debate, so while the supposed problem people have is the circular definition, the only real problem many of them have with it is that it makes a step towards including trans people rather than ostracising them. Not to say that why you believe this, the ""circular definitions are bad"" thing sounds reasonable and logical at first, but thats why I've attempted to illustrate that they aren't necessarily bad so you can see the real reason many people say this. And you know what, while I'm here I might as well bring this up. I believe I saw in another comment that you mentioned the reason you believe the concept of being trans to be a mental illness is because of a hatred of the current body caused by gender dysphoria. This seems to imply that dysphoria is an inherent part of being trans, which is simply not the case. Being trans is defined by euphoria, not dysphoria. It is the happiness brought about by expressing another gender identity that makes someone trans, not necessarily the sadness caused by their current one. Many people who are transfemme or transmasc may simply prefer expressing themselves as the other gender but not hate the one they were assigned at birth. And while I don't know as much about these identities, it seems to me that many demi-boys, demi-girls, and other people who express more androgynous gender identities may already feel their body matches the way they want to look and simply want to make changes to their day to day life. And I definitely don't know enough about neogenders to attempt to explain their relationship with gender dysphoria, although that doesn't make them any less valid I just personally don't know much about them. So there are plenty of examples of trans people who aren't unhappy with the body they were born in, so I don't really see how this could be called a mental illness. I hope this helped explain some points you seemed confused on, and hope you have a nice day

---

Firstly, I'd like to bring up I wouldn't say dictionary definitions are how we typically explain simpler concepts like sandwich, women, man, or human. I don't recall ever being taught exactly what a sandwich was or looking that word up in the dictionary, I'm pretty sure concepts such as that were taught by people pointing at pictures and saying things like ""this is a sandwich and this is not"" but thats as far as I'll expand on that right now as I feel this definition argument is growing repetitive and isn't really going anywhere. As for the concept of gender euphoria, I'd be happy to expand on that. It's really something fairly simply, its the term used to refer to the happiness felt by expressing the gender identity which you can identify with. Its hard to be mire specific than that as what causes gender euphoria varies from person to person and identity to identity. It can come from simple things like wearing gender affirming clothing or using gender affirming pronouns or it can come from slightly more drastic things like hormones and surgery. Every person who identifies as anything under the trans umbrella feels some kind of gender euphoria when they do certain gender affirming things (as far as I know anyways), whereas not everyone under that umbrella feels the gender dysphoria typically associated with being trans. Though not an expert on the subject, I'm fairly certain the reason its defined by euphoria rather than dysphoria is not only because of the identities mentioned in my previous comment but also because a cis person expressing their gender identity in a way besides the one assigned at birth wouldn't feel that euphoria, whereas a trans person would feel euphoria even if they've never felt dysphoria before. I hope that helps to explain it as thats the best I can do with a general overview. If you have more specific questions I may be able to answer them but as mentioned previously I'm not an expert on the subject so what I've said above is most of what I know",2022-07-25 14:46:08,2022-07-26 19:40:08

I don't ""feel like"" a man, I just am one because I was born with XY chromosomes. I believe this to be the experience of anyone not suffering from dysphoria.

Why do you believe that your experience must be the same as everyone's experience, even though many people report ""feeling like"" a particular gender?

Have you considered the possibility that you may be ""agender"" or ""non gendered"", but that many people are not?

---

Did you have a similar ""further discussion"" with the trans people you have told you they ""feel like"" a gender?

I notice that you originally wrote simply of ""gender identity"" but now you are saying ""innate gender identity"". I'm confused why you believe (or possibly believe that many others believe?) that gender identity is supposedly fixed since birth and unaffected by cultural norms. It seems that most people agree that gender is a social construct, and if it is, then it _must_ be affected by cultural norms.

I know many trans people and absolutely none of them claim that their gender identity is unaffected by cultural norms. I'm sure there are some trans people who do believe this (the world is a big place after all), but I think they would comprise a small minority of the trans community.

---

&gt;If you are implying I am only willing to engage with cis people on this topic, that is demonstrably false.

Not at all. I figured that you probably had spoken with trans people the same way, but I find it prudent to double check my assumptions. There have been times where previously I have not done so and a few comments later it became apparent and it could have saved a lot of confusion if I had just asked first.

&gt;I have seen it defined that way over and over again

Do you have some examples you could share? I tried to look through the thread, but at over a thousand comments, I'm only able to read a fraction of them.

To be clear, I'm not saying it's _only_ affected by social norms. Only that social norms have at least _some_ effect on gender identity (how much of an effect probably varies from person to person).

You mentioned talking to 2 cis men who said they ""feel like a man"" but then it turned out that was only their ""constructed identity"". What do you mean by ""constructed identity"", and how is it different from what you are calling ""innate gender identity""?

Is it possible that the lack of ""feeling like"" one's gender that you experience is really a lack of dysphoria?

If the world had to choose just 20 people to survive it would come down to the person choosing and 19 other people. Very few people would not have themselves in that last 20 people.

I get anger over that. I'm guilty of thinking similar things when I hear certain stories. That's does not mean we should change the system to something as monstrous. Mire thought should be put into deciding who should be killed by a society than just being angry about a specific incident or collection if them don't you think?

---

Do you think the victim of a crime should decide the punishment of the person who committed said crime?

Or should it be a person that can put some distance between them and the situation so it can be fair to both parties?

Murder in most situations is not the kind of crime that gets repeated. It's mostly stupid choices people make. Sometimes people just don't value human life enough and that leads them to do it which incidentally is the same mistake you are making. 

If you chose to implement your system today and one innocent person was killed based on your ideas does that not make you a murder in your mind, so that's death correct?

Murder can range from drunk driving to a person loosing their temper and pushing someone who knocks their head all the way to serial killers who just don't have the part of the brain that let's them believe its wrong to do so. Can you really group all those people under the same assumption that they deserve death?

Like digitally re-creating human faces has come on incredibly far, i've seen creepily realisitc images, but not only does that get harder and harder the more unplanned the situation is (in movies they can control things like lighting and angles to a tee to show off in the best light) but the very best ones tend to use real humans as base templates.

But translating that into the real world is an even bigger step and one which has had much less R&amp;D and brainpower go into it than making digital faces to date. The skin is really hard to mimic, even statically, but when you factor in hair growth, sweat, mperfections etc it gets even harder. that;'s not even looking at all the muscles and micro-movements of the muscles under the skin and having those things happen at the right cues and in time so they don't look weird

[check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXlQuTRSmzc) it's basically state of the art and while it's better than what's come before, it's hilariously far from being convincing to the point where you think it's an actual human, especially if you look at it for more than a few seconds

And all of that is just looking at visual cues, the second you go in for a hug or a handshake you won't feel squishy biology or heat, you'll feel maybe squishy articifical stuff over a frame, but that squishiness will be uneven and weird, you know what it feels like to squeeze a hand, if there are heaters in it, the heat will be patchy and uneven, at best you'll think this is a very very sick person

ihuy63t,ProLifePanda,"&gt;Obviously he isn't a perfect president but he followed through with many of his promises from the campaign trail which is rare for a president and this meant enacting conservative policy.

So he is far from perfect. Trump came with A LOT of personal baggage (the pussy tape, his questionable Russian ties, Stormy Daniels payoff, intentionally inflammatory and divisive tweets, etc.). A lot of the personal strife that came with Trump could likely be done away with by getting another conservative.

While Trump did get stuff done, any conservative president can also get stuff done, and in fact get MORE done who knows what they're doing. Trump had no plan for healthcare, which is why Obamacare is still around. A President who was knowledgeable and put in the effort to develop a replacement would have gotten rid of Obamacare. Trumps Administration lost A LOT of court battles because his Administration routinely violated the APA and improperly implemented or changed regulations and policies. Trump didn't particularly care about who was working under him, and routinely had his own agents work against him and undermining his causes. 

All these problems can be gone if you get a competent politician at the helm.

&gt;He is doing what he says and enacting conservatives policies.

Would DeSantis not? Would Ted Cruz not enact conservative policies?

&gt;He appointed three conservative supreme court justices. 

Any Republican President would. This is such a lame ""success"". Appointing SCOTUS justices is the easiest ""success"" in the world if you're a President with the Senate.

&gt;Who cares about his personal life or the way he speaks?

I prefer my party leader to NOT open themselves and the party up to constant criticism and having to play defense. There were MANY times the Administration and party officials had to run around trying to put out fires Trump started because of the way he speaks and his personal life. 

&gt;The Jan 6th thing is a joke and not worth even talking about

Ignoring the riots, what about the fact he was openly trying to get Pence to ignore state certified electors (against the law) and instead acknowledge fake electors in an effort to stay in power? I'm generally opposed to my party leader ignoring democracy.

I'd much rather have a ""new Trump"" like DeSantis or Jim Jordan than have Trump run again with his baggage listed above.

---

So just off the bat, you ignored many of my points and jumped straight to the couple you seemed to rebut elsewhere.

&gt;I don't care about the personal stuff...

Do other people? Do you think his personal strife is partly what cost him the 2020 election? Do you want to support a candidate whose personal strife is likely to lose another election? Even if YOU don't care, others do and you have to worry whether or not you candidate will win, in which case his personal strife has a direct impact on whether you should support him to win or not.

&gt;DeSantis yes but he is trying to be a clone of Trump. Cruz no.

So just without digging into this, this is exactly why many people support DeSantis over Trump. He's Trump without the baggage. He's also knowledgeable about how government works and would pu together a better Executive Branch to enact the policies he wants.

Why support a guy who lost who comes with TONS of baggage over someone you agree is ""trying to be a clone of Trump""? A DeSantis Administration would likely be more efficient and less bogged down by personal issues and ineffective changes than a 2nd Trump Administration.

You also didn't address his ineptitude which COST him from enacting many changes, the fact so many of his ""Best people"" worked against him, or him trying to implement the fake elector scheme to overthrow the democratic election.",2022-07-27 07:00:58,2022-07-27 07:58:57

1: Deer have way bigger and more complex brains than robins

2: Hunting season is in the fall when deer were naturally hunted at higher rates by their natural predators prior to humans killing them all. All we did was step into that niche.

ihvbwyx,McKoijion,"My heart is human. Historically, people thought that's where love came from. But it turns out love exists only in the brain. The heart is just an tool that pumps blood to my brain. If I get a heart transplant, my old heart would be dead. But I would continue to be alive. But if my heart is used in a heart transplant for someone else, I would be dead even though my heart would beat on in someone else.

This ultimately means that our consciousness/personality/soul exists in the brain, not in the rest of our body. All your other cells are human life, but they aren't important. We can grow heart cells in a lab and they start beating right in the lab dish. But we can't grow a human personality/consciousness/soul. It's also not all parts of the brain, just the upper parts. The lower parts just manage unconscious, mechanical actions like breathing when we aren't paying attention to it.

In this way, a fetus is human. Everyone, including 99% of the National Academy of Sciences, agrees life starts at conception. The question is whether that consciousness/personality/soul also starts at conception. Evangelical Christian people people say all living cells are special. Scientists typically say that you need to form the bare minimum parts of a brain that can house a consciousness/personality/soul before you can even begin to have one. Reaching that point takes about 6 months. Before that point a fetus can't exist outside the mother. But coincidentally (or not coincidentally) after that point, the fetus can live outside the mother.

When people say ""human"" in this context they mean a person with a consciousness/personality/soul. They don't typically mean replaceable organic human tissue like hair, fingernails, skin cells, bones, livers, etc. In this way, killing a fetus after it forms a consciousness/soul/personality is murder. Aborting a fetus before it forms the bare minimum brain parts to house a consciousness/soul/personality is the moral equivalent of a haircut.

---

Human brains don’t fully develop until 25 or even 30 years old. Even after 6 months, it probably takes a long time to develop a consciousness/personality/soul. But I want to avoid even the bare minimum risk of hurting a human with a personality/consciousness/soul. That means if they have the bare minimum structures needed to have thoughts, I wouldn’t abort. That takes about 5-6 months. There’s a few weeks of variation because sperm can live in a woman for a while, nuances of the ovulation cycle, tiny differences in rates of development between fetuses, etc.

This doesn’t apply to all fetuses. Many have major developmental defects that prevent them from ever developing upper brain structures. They can be aborted well after 6 months. If they aren’t, they’ll be stillborn. Furthermore, sometimes fetuses develop brains, but it ends up being a life of mother vs. life of baby and mother trade off. I’d consider this to be a horrible circumstance that’s similar to a child dying in a car crash. It’s just a sad part of life. Lastly, it can be either a mother or baby trade off. Then it’s the trolley problem. 

The great thing about this is that the early abortion technique basically stops the fetus from developing, thereby killing it. There is a 0 percent chance a 4 month fetus has the upper brain structures to house a consciousness/personality/soul. The later 5-6 month method is to just induce labor and give birth to the fetus. If it survives, it reached the point of developing upper brain structures and can be put up for adoption. If it is stillborn, it never developed the upper brain structures in the first place.

Ultimately, modern abortion techniques mean there’s a 0 percent chance of ever harming a fetus with the bare minimum brain structures to house a consciousness/personality/soul. Even a 0.00001% chance would be unacceptable. But it’s 0% unless you think all human cells are sacred, not just the ones capable of consciousness. I distinguish between the mind/soul and the earthly body, so I think abortion is completely acceptable.",2022-07-27 08:35:05,2022-07-27 09:26:48

You have written your argument in a way that suggests the concept of ""dangerous"" cannot meaningfully apply to objects, and that we cannot compare the risk of certain objects/situations with other objects/situations. But that obviously seems like an absurd conclusion to make; it goes against the reality that guns allow violence more easily than other tools, it goes against obvious intuition because we *know* certain objects and situations pose more risk than others, and it goes against effective communication because even if you conclude that guns aren't ""dangerous"", we still need a word for the very obvious increased capacity for violence or harm that guns pose.

This is why we have protections for migratory birds in America because shooting one in Canada is killing a bird that would end up in Mexico causing all kinds of regulation and jurisdictions problems. 

California quail how ever do not migrate. Well they do but not nearly as much and are generally localized.

You'd have to create a somewhat arbitrary definition around ""natural development potential"" or some such thing to say a single or several cell embryo is a human and not other cells from a human that could be cloned.    At some point a multi-cell embryo can become a human, but it seems reasonable to take the position there is no bright line.

It appears you are trying to unfairly recast the debate on abortion around only ""justified killing"", and you are saying anyone who doesn't do this is arguing in bad faith.  There are probably few people who think it's OK to abort an 8.5 month old fetus.   Most people probably agree that murder is bad and terminating the life of a baby after it is born is murder.   However, there is a legitimate debate on when the embryo or fetus becomes sufficiently human to be protected as an individual.   Of course, the whole topic of abortion is also intertwined with a woman's autonomy over her body.   You seem to want to say that how people feel about the last point (the legal rights of a woman's autonomy over her body) is determining their position on the first point (when is a fetus a protected individual).   Maybe some people do that, which is perhaps your  point, but it seems unfair and untrue to say that most people are unable to deal with two intertwined topics somewhat independently.   People can legitimately disagree on when a fetus becomes a protected individual.

[**This article**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/opinion/transgender-children-medical-bills.html) has a pretty good overview of why. [**Psychology Today has one too**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/political-minds/202008/three-popular-myths-about-transgender-youth), and  [**here**](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the guidelines from the AAP. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender, and some of those young kids are trans. A child who is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their visible anatomy at birth can suffer debilitating distress over this conflict. The *""90% desist""* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth.

According to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/), but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes the gender expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The genders of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).

For preadolescents transition is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is 100% temporary puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will ""desist"" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest. And transition-related medical care is recognized as medically necessary, frequently life saving medical care by every major medical authority. 

Withholding medical care from an adolescent who needs it is not a goddamn neutral option. Transition is absolutely necessary to keep many trans kids alive. Without transition a hell of a lot of them commit suicide. When able to transition rates of suicide attempts drop to the national average. And when prevented from transitioning or starting treatment until adulthood, those who survive long enough to start at 18+ enter adulthood facing thousands of dollars reconstructive surgery to repair damage that should have been prevented by starting treatment when they needed it.

And not all that damage can be repaired. They will carry physical and psychological scars from being forced through the wrong puberty for the rest of their lives. They were robbed of their adolescence, forced to spend it dealing with the living hell of untreated dysphoria and the wrong puberty, trying to remain sane and alive while their bodies were warped in indescribably horrifying ways. Even with treatment as adults, some of them will be left permanently, visibly trans. In addition to the sheer horror of permanently having anatomy inappropriate to your gender, this means they will never have the option of blending into a crowd or keeping their medical history private. They will be exposed to vastly higher rates of anti-trans harassment, discrimination, abuse, and violence, all because they were denied the treatment they needed when they were young.

This is very literally life saving medical care. If there is even a chance that an adolescent may be trans, there is absolutely no reason to withhold 100% temporary and fully reversible hormone blockers to delay puberty for a little while until they're sure. This treatment is 100% temporary and fully reversible; it does nothing but buy time by delaying the onset of permanent physical changes. 

This treatment is very safe and well known, because it has been used for decades to delay puberty in children who would have otherwise started it inappropriately young. If an adolescent starts this treatment then realizes medical transition isn't what they need, they stop treatment and puberty picks up where it left off. There are no permanent effects, and it significantly improves trans youth's mental health and [**lowers suicidality**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/01/21/peds.2019-1725).

But if an adolescent starts this treatment, socially transitions (or continues if they have already done so), and by their early/mid-teens they still strongly identify as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, the chances of them changing their minds later are basically zero. At that point hormone therapy becomes an option, and even that is still mostly reversible, especially in its early stages. The only really irreversible step is reconstructive genital surgery and/or the removal of one's gonads, which isn't an option until the patient is in their late teens at the earliest. 

This specter of little kids being pressured into transition and rapidly pushed into permanent physical changes is a complete myth. It just isn't happening. And this fear-mongering results in nothing except trans youth who desperately do need to transition being discouraged and prevented from doing so. Withholding medical treatment from an adolescent who desperately needs it is not a neutral option.

The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375/#.pqspdcee0). When prevented from transitioning about 40% of trans kids will attempt suicide. When able to transition that rate drops to the national average. Trans kids who socially transition early, have access to appropriate transition related medical treatment, and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are [**comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696)

So what's the difference?

Your answers are not consistent.

Ok, but then neither is a fetus by logic explained above. 


&gt;The main difference is that the resources required for a fetus are a natural part of its development.

[This is a ""naturalistic fallacy.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy)

Just because something is natural does not mean that it carries more moral weight or meaning. 

&gt; Not so for a skin cell - which if left to its own devices and without human intervention ...  will remain a skin cell.

I mean this is very much true for a fetus as well.  If you leave it out on a table without very heavy human intervention, it will very much die very quickly just like a skin cell. 

I fail to see why does it matter if a process is ""natural"" or not.  Can you please elaborate why does natural or unnatural nature of human intervention matter?  After all they are both human interventions.

It's still a fallacy. 

I fail to see a connection between a cell being human or not and whether the process of development is natural or not.   You say it is, but you don't explain WHY. 

By your logic if we DID clone a skin cell and it grew up into an adult, it would not be human.

Again, BOTH skin cell and embryo require **extensive** human intervention to develop inot an adult human being.  both would die if you leave them out on a table.

That would contradict your view in OP.

ihw2kly,badass_panda,"Just to clarify, you're talking about surgery specifically. I'm not sure how controversial that is on its own.

However, here's where you jump off a big old cliff:

&gt;I also don’t think that minors should be allowed to take puberty blockers, as the side effects can be permanent vision loss and IIH. IIH also has increased risks for other problems, like depression, suicide

This is an absurd position for you to take. I'm not trying to be a jerk, just pointing out that you've set up a glaringly false dichotomy. You're saying that children shouldn't be allowed to make choices that irrevocably affect their bodies -- fine, but how on earth is *going through puberty* ***not*** *an irreversible change on their body?*

Let's lay it out:

1. **Among adults who self-identify as transgender, gender affirming therapies are highly effective and achieve a substantial reduction in rates of suicide and self-harm.** This is non-controversial; it's the accepted medical position. Unless you believe that the American Medical Association, Psychological Association, Pediatric Association, National Institute of Health and World Health Organization have all failed to review the literature and make an informed, patient-oriented choice, I shouldn't have to prove this to you.
2. **These therapies correct, largely, for the effects of puberty.** While bottom surgery specifically does not, all the other surgical interventions are responses to puberty.

The choice isn't between, ""Do nothing and nothing bad happens,"" vs ""Do something and possibly get bad headaches.""

The choice is between, ""Do nothing and go through puberty, greatly increasing dysmorphia and suicidal ideation,"" and ""Do something, defer puberty, and very slightly increase the chance of negative side effects.""

Why *on earth* should the effect that we *know* is certain, and that is quite *likely* to be negative, be viewed as ""safe"" (over the experiences of trans people themselves, and the recommendations of medical personnel) while the slightest possibility of a side effect from a treatment that prevents it is ""too dangerous""?

Six cases, ever, supporting a plausible (but not confirmed) association between GnRH agonists and IIH. Of these six cases five were cis children with precocious puberty, but I don't see you calling for their treatment to be withheld. And as of the time of the paper's writing, symptoms had already resolved in three patients and were resolving in a fourth.

By comparison, antibiotics trigger toxic epidermal necrolysis, a devastating and often fatal reaction that causes the victim's skin to peel off, in 0.4–1.2 per million people per year. And unlike GnRH argonists and IIH, the connection between antibiotics and TEN is confirmed.

An yet I don't see you calling for minors to be categorically denied antibiotics. Nor should you, because as terrible as TEN is denying minors this treatment when it is needed would cause vastly more harm than providing it knowing there is a very small risk it will cause their skin to peel off.

GnRH argonists are also only one type of puberty delaying treatment. There are also GnRH antagonist, which act through a completely different mechanism to inhibit gonadotropin secretion. Progestogens are another alternative, as is the antiandrogen bicalutamide, and aromatase inhibitors and antiestrogens medication.

---

&gt; We should prioritize the treatment methods that don’t have as many side effects and are more effective.

What side effects?

Six cases worldwide that may support a plausible but unconfirmed association between GnRH agonists and IIH is not ""side effects"". It is a possible, but not confirmed, very rare complication.

Every medication has the potential for very rare severe complications. Taking an aspirin can kill you. Antibiotics can make your skin peel off. A vaccine can cause an allergic reaction that leads to anaphylaxis and death. But many medications, including puberty delaying treatment, have proven to have incredibly low rates of serious complications. Amoxicillin is more likely to kill you than GnRH is likely to trigger IIH.

And what ""disagreement"" do you imagine is happening here? You pulled this shit out of your own ass. There is no medical controversy here. You're highlighting a tiny handful cases that might support an unconfirmed association between IIH and a particular treatment for the purpose of attacking trans youth's access to medically necessary and frequently life saving medical care, even though nearly all of these vanishingly rare cases were affecting cis youth, and most of those youth were recovering or had already recovered before the one and only paper on it was published.

Alright, so if you believe it's the result of human choice, then you should be more inquisitive and inform yourself on the actual mechanics of modern economies. 

To make it short: none of the monetary scarcity the governments with a fiat currency (like the US and the UK) is real. Money is not scarce, and in fact, central banks must pay whatever their respective governments instruct them to. Money must be generated before it can be regained with tax. No money spent, no taxation. Inflation is about maintaing a balance between money taxed back and savings. When money is in circulation, it multiplies the tax coming back. When it goes towards only 1% of the population, it dies. 

Inflation is run by never before seen profits for shareholders. The wealth generated is extracted from the working class, if not injected by the state. 

That's simple modern economics since abandoned the gold standard. Nothing more, nothing less. 

People at the top, the richest, who make money through the financial markets, count on people not realising that money is indeed not scarce. Banks wouldn't be able to ask for a higher interest, and eventually own half a country via asset seizing.

It's not conspiratorial. It's the sad reality.

This form of capitalism started generating wealth in a cycle that was supposed to last forever. People at the top are making more money than ever. Way above inflation. 

It's only human to imagine a response from the working class, which is currently asked to take the brunt of the supply issues. 

If you understand those economic concepts, then you have to concede that the most logical response would be advocate for change.",2022-07-27 13:37:00,2022-07-27 13:51:00

ihwp0w2,budlejari,"&gt; You can also get PCs for much less than consoles if you have a tight budget.

Cheap PCs do not do well with heavy games that need a lot of resources. They just don't. I play the Sims on a pretty high spec PC that has a lot of custom content and mods. A low end laptop will set itself on fire and scream as it burns if I tried to play on it. Low end PCs, as the suggestion says, are low end. They are not intended to take the strain of heavy gaming and thus, if you want to PC game, you have to pay the price. My PC was $1500. I am not a builder, I cannot build my own so I had to pay the price to have someone else do it for me. I can get a PS5 with higher specs than my current PC that does a lot of extra things for 1/2 the price and still have enough to buy a decent enough tv to not worry about it. 

You underestimate the value of plug and play devices, too. A console is accessible for a large number of younger people who lack the knowledge or the patience to build a good quality PC with all the bells and whistles needed. It's easy for parents to buy, too - a child could send almost any parent for a PS5 as a birthday gift and they'd come back with a PS5. Give them a shopping list for a high spec PC or the parts and they'd be baffled. 

It's also more accessible in general. Grandma doesn't type, doesn't know how to use the computer that is barely powerful enough to run amazon, and doesn't have internet. What she does have is a TV and the willingness to let her three grandkids come over for the weekend and hook up their console to her tv and let them game for hours. Grandma can even join in - there's less buttons, the joy sticks are intutitve and the device is easy to hold for her arthritic hands. 

&gt; Console has extremly limited modding abilities. Few games on console have mods at all, and if they have the selection is limited compared to PC.

Not everybody wants mods. Some people are purists. 

&gt; There is no hardware advantage in competative multiplayer games. There still is. Different people will use different versions of the console, have different screens with different input lag, have different internet speed. Consoles do even the playing field by a small amount, but we are splitting hairs at this point.

Someone who plays with a 2016 macbook and someone who plays with a 2021 heavy duty desktop will have different experiences, different conditions, and different outcomes.

The pit bulls originally bred are not the same house pets you see today. That being said, I’m not one of those people that say it’s all in the way you raise them and pitbulls aren’t any more dangerous than another large breed. Different breeds have different capabilities and different temperaments and most people who have had dogs their whole lives would agree with that. There’s also a such thing as a bad dog just like there are bad humans but that is rare. There are numerous breeds that don’t make good house pets and are much more aggressive and dangerous than the common pitbull that are not recognized for it because they aren’t common like the pit bull. Many working breeds have demand as house pets so you have dogs like the Belgian Malinois, Caucasian ovcharka, high content wolf dogs, the dogo Argentino being sold as pets which is often a disaster. But others like German shepherds and huskies and pit bulls have been bred as pets for long enough that they have significantly distinguished themselves from the working lineage. 

That being said, I’ve grown up around dogs my entire life including dozens of pitbulls with family and friends and none of them were aggressive. I’ve been taking my dogs to the dog park for 2 decades where there are half a dozen pitbulls and any given time that I’ve never met and none of them have ever been aggressive. But I grew up in a higher income area. I think a lot of the statistics for violence among dogs as well as people are a result of socioeconomic conditions. Also, most pitbulls are pit mixes at best and any time something remotely looks like it has pit in it following an incident is labeled pit bull which skews the statistics a bit and makes it more complicated.

I think we can still construct counterexamples to that formulation.

I don’t really see how that’s relevant.

ihxfyin,breckenridgeback,"People have weird fetishes for all sorts of things. It doesn't make them weak, bad, useless, insecure, or anything else.

Want to see how? Hi, I am into weird shit (at least as weird as anything furries are into, and often weirder), and I've taken a pretty good beating from life and come out standing on the other end. I'm not perfect, but I'm in a pretty good place where my own well-being is secure and I have the resources to help other people. Turns out, my fetishes have nothing to do with any of that.

So, to go point by point:

&gt; But this is a weird subject, or atleast weird to me. Because it's abnormal and different, it's only natural of me to defy it.

Why? Why does everyone else have to make sense to you personally? There are a *lot* of people and a *lot* of ways of life in this world, and you certainly aren't going to understand all of them.

&gt; I think it's weak, I think it's weird, it's absolutely pathetic

Why?

I'm into weird shit. I go into my bedroom, do sexy things, and then go back to my life, which is pretty successful! Nothing about the one interferes with the other. It's not like I'm watching porn at work or whatever.

&gt; My best guess would be. This is a coping mechanism for insecurities. I suspect Complex-PSTD. Maybe people develop this same way someone would develop a eating disorder, devolop being a cuck or things of that nature. I suspect childhood trauma, self esteem issues, depression probably, etc.

_shrug_ maybe? I mean, people have kinks for all sorts of reasons. Rape victims, for example, often have rape fantasies afterward - obviously being raped is Very Very Bad, but that doesn't mean the coping mechanism is. Coping mechanisms can be ways to process or route around the difficulties everyone struggles with.

&gt; Even trying to sympathize for them on why furries are like this is hard for me. I just can't correlate to these people, they run from their problems.

How is getting off to weird shit ""running from their problems""? Like, what, you want them to pause roleplaying in the bedroom to do some professional development? Take off the fursuit for a few minutes to work on their MBA?

&gt; I just imagine them fucking sad, not because of what life has gave them (and the cards they're dealt), but because of what THEY'VE done to their life. Which to me is the most unrespectable way to live imo, because their whole existence is an excuse. It's a sorry way to live. 

I think you may think furries are something very different from what they actually are, based on the way you're talking about them. Can you define the term?

&gt; And I think it's okay to be weak and feel sad and angry, but it's not okay to STAY weak. 

Even if being a furry had anything to do with weakness (and it doesn't), weakness isn't a crime. Some people aren't super durable, or have had rough paths in life. Yes, it's often a *good idea* to try to become stronger or more durable, but that doesn't make you a bad person if you don't. And for that matter, getting stronger is a long and difficult process that takes a lot of energy, and sometimes you want to put that struggle down for a while.

&gt; You live in a first world country, opportunity and freedom is in the name of the USA. PEOPLE WOULD DREAM TO HAVE YOUR PROBLEMS, and you chose to do this?

Choose to use the fact that you're living a generally safe and secure life to, you know, enjoy that life? Yeah, I mean...why wouldn't they?

(The answer is ""not very"".)

Frankly, OP, I think you're coming from a place similar to where I came from many years ago. You feel like you're smarter and better than other people, but you're getting worse results, and the only way you can square that is to claim some sort of moral superiority over them. If that's the case, take it from me: set aside your ego for a bit and try to work on results without it. You can have it back once you've made something of it.

---

I think the ""why"" is a lot more emotional than it is logical. You're trying to reason yourself out of a position you don't seem to have reasoned yourself into. In other words, you're trying to out-logic bitterness and anger, and that never works.

---

It's hard.

If you're like I was - I don't know that you are, but you show some of the same patterns - one of the first steps is to recognize the way in which that judgement turns inward.

For me, during the worst years of my life, the worst part of it wasn't being poor, or not seeing a path forward, or being stuck where I was. It was the overwhelming, crushing sense of failure. I thought - rightly, as it turns out - that I had all these crazy talents, and yet, there I was, crying alone in my bedroom because I just couldn't do anything.

There were two missing pieces for me.

-----

The first was learning to forgive weakness. I was, at the time, severely mentally ill. I don't know if you've ever been to a doctor for depression care, but one of the things they'll have you do is fill out a little form that asks some simple questions to see if you have the symptoms of depression. Then you score it, and it's like 0-8 is normal, 9-12 is mild depression, 13-16 is moderate, 17+ is severe or something like that (I don't recall the exact numbers). I scored, like, 35. 

You'd think that would have been enough, but it wasn't! Because I was clinging to my self-image as someone who was smarter than everybody else (just about the only bit of positive self-image I had at the time), I rejected the idea that that meant anything was really wrong with my thinking. ""Yeah, sure,"" I'd say, ""I'm miserable and suicidal, but that's just because I'm rationally looking at &lt;list of reasons&gt;."" Those reasons weren't (all) false, I really was in a bad place, but they weren't *why* I was depressed - they were tools that the depressed parts of my mind used to hurt the rest of me.

What finally did it was getting on an antidepressant. It didn't work for very long, and I've never found one that has. But for a couple of days, I got to wake up and all the stuff in my head that was yelling at me was just silent. And that's when I understood that I was sick, not bad, and I could approach the problem from a different angle.

But the thing is that that voice that was yelling at me was the same voice that judged other people. I've tried not to be too much of an outward asshole - although that certainly took some work earlier in my life - but, well, [you ever seen this XKCD](https://xkcd.com/610/)? That. 

I judged other people for watching the wrong TV (""why are they watching this trash?"" - as it turns out, because they like it). Or listening to the wrong music (""how can anyone like this stupid bass?"" - I dunno, still not my thing, but obviously lots of people do). Or socializing the wrong way (""why are they just going along with the crowd? dumb sheep."" - because they're trying not to create social friction so they can enjoy time with others even if that time isn't spent on the Strictly Optimal Social Activity). I was exercising that judgemental ""muscle"" in my mind, and that judgement got turned inward, too.

For me, at least, that was learned. I grew up in a home that was very judgemental, and I internalized it. I didn't think of it as a bad thing, I thought of it as what you're supposed to do in order to force yourself to be better. And maybe that works sometimes - I do think I've pushed through some things that a less-disciplined person might not have. But it has a dark side, and that dark side can eat you alive when you stumble enough for it to get a grip.

It was only when I recognized that, and started cutting both myself and others some slack, that I was able to get stronger. There's a weird way in which accepting your weaknesses and making them part of you can bring incredible amounts of strength, because you're not fighting with yourself so much.

----

The other, related, half was realizing that I was judging people who were, in many respects, doing better than I was! It was ridiculous of me, someone who was lonely and struggled with social interactions, to think I knew better how to socialize than people who had many healthy relationships. What arrogance it was to sit in my bedroom and try to tell other people *actually living their lives* how living their lives was supposed to work!

What that meant was that I needed to accept that I was wrong in ways I couldn't see yet. Not factually wrong, necessarily. It's a different kind of wrong, a wrongness of judgement and of thought pattern. In particular:

* I was too quick to reject things I did not understand. And in particular, to assume that when I could not see the logic, that there was none. (It's this particular thread that I detect in your OP.)
* I was too focused on a consistent *model* for how and why things worked, and not on the fact *that* they worked. My models had failed me, a lot. I needed to set the models aside.
* I didn't have enough respect for just trying things. I was too quick to reject new approaches out of hand, especially ones that gave me a sense of ""well if it was that obvious it would be easy, so..."". I started just *trying* things, and imitating people who were successful in ways I wasn't.
* And I was beginning from the assumption that I was right and others were wrong. There are certainly domains in which that's a pretty good assumption - I am very hard to beat in my areas of expertise - but no one is an expert in everything and I had some glaring weaknesses. I had to find the humility to say ""I want to do better at this, because I am bad at it right now, and I need to accept that my approaches don't work well here"".

-----

But, to get back to you for a second: I think the first and most important thing you can do is to try to separate your feelings from your logic, and your logic from your ego.

To go back to my own depression: if I had been able to say ""I feel sad right now for no particular reason, and today is just a shitty day"", I would have been a lot healthier. But I couldn't do that, because it Wasn't Okay to have a feeling or a need or a desire I couldn't prove or justify. So if I was sad, I needed for that sadness to be Totally Rationally Justified, which meant my circumstances had to actually *be* as inescapable as they felt. Otherwise my feelings would be irrational, and that was unacceptable.

What that does is co-opts your reasoning and your intelligence to serve your negative emotions. It hands all your tools of logic and rhetoric and observation to depression so that it can use them to beat you to death.

Instead, try to take your emotions as just a thing you have to deal with. It's like you're an architect trying to build a house - the shape of the land is just something you have to deal with. It might be something you can modify to some extent, but it's just *there*. It's an input, not an output. So you can just say things like ""I feel bad right now"", and stop there. Or you can go ""I have no motivation today, and so I'm going to decide that I'm giving myself a rest day rather than fighting with myself all day"" (I actually did this today! I'm struggling with a bout of my own depression at the moment, but it isn't getting the same hold of me because I understand it a lot better than I used to.)

To be more specific: you seem angry. You use words like ""hate"" and ""pathetic"" here. In fact, you even say it makes you angry, but I don't think it does: I think you were *already* angry, and this is the reason you're using to justify that anger (because being angry for no reason Wouldn't Be Okay). Try handling the anger as a thing that exists in its own right, independent of justification or circumstance or logic.",2022-07-27 17:53:19,2022-07-27 18:24:08

ihxtb2p,aweirdoatbest,"“integrate.” You are describing conversion therapy. I would be happy to link countless articles that disprove the attempts to “integrate the mind and body.” The only proven treatment method for gender dysphoria is transitioning.

---

What would “integrating” the mind and body look like to you then? Because it sounds like you’re trying to convince the mind to be okay with the body, which is essentially conversion therapy. I’m glad you agree than conversion therapy is disgusting but I don’t see how what you’re describing is any different. 

CBT involves changing thinking patterns from distortions in thinking (https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral). Being transgender is not a distortion, so CBT is ineffective at relieving gender dysphoria. 

DBT “helps people learn and use new skills and strategies” (https://www.camh.ca/en/health-info/mental-illness-and-addiction-index/dialectical-behaviour-therapy). Skills and strategies for gender dysphoria include medical and social transitioning.

---

The definition of conversion therapy according to GLAAD is “any attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.” It doesn’t say anything about the methods used. Talk therapy can absolutely be used as a form of conversion therapy. The UK government found that the two most common methods of conversion therapy are spiritual methods and psychological methods, the latter of which they specifically provide “talking therapies” as an example (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conversion-therapy-an-evidence-assessment-and-qualitative-study/conversion-therapy-an-evidence-assessment-and-qualitative-study. Reducing feelings of being in the wrong body is literally another way of saying “try to stop something from feeling like they’re transgender.” 
The definition of distorting is “give a misleading or false account or impression of.” But someone being transgender is not a false account. Studies show that people do not fake or trick themselves into believing they’re trans. Trans people even tend to have brain activity similar to cisgender people of the gender they identify with (https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/). It’s not a distortion.",2022-07-27 18:25:02,2022-07-27 19:20:43

ihy4efs,stubble3417,"Consider the the CEO of turbotax. Like all tax preparation companies, turbotax spends tens of millions of dollars to lobby the US government to protect their extremely lucrative tax preparation business. Among other things, this includes ensuring that the tax code stays highly complicated. If taxes and exemptions were simplified, or even reduced to a simple bill the government sends you based on the information they already have, turbotax would instantly become irrelevant. 

Now, who is contributing more to society: the CEO of intuit (turbotax's corporate name) who makes about $25,000,000 a year? Or an artist who is commissioned to create pieces for public buildings, spaces, and parks? 

Here's the unfortunate truth: most jobs are unnecessary. Maybe not as starkly unnecessary as turbotax. How about my dad, who worked for 40 years in health insurance, but whose job was only ""necessary"" at all because he happened to live in a country that keeps refusing to join the rest of the developed world in providing universal healthcare? How about advertising agencies? Would the world be better or worse tomorrow if coca-cola stopped spending 4 billion dollars a year manipulating people into dumping sugar down their throats? 

If you don't think art has real value compared to things like farming or construction, that's understandable. We need food and clothing. But I would argue that artist is one of the few jobs that doesn't create *negative* value for society. Society would actually be better if many people stopped working entirely. I would love to see the CEO of intuit get paid $25 million to do nothing, because the world would be a better place if he just did watercolors all day than it is with him going to work.

---

Haha I'll take that as a compliment. But the point is that society is ass backwards. I don't want to contribute to a society where people get rich by making everyone's life worse and worse. I'd rather play a song that makes you feel calm, or draw a picture that makes you laugh, or write a story that humanizes people and makes you more empathic. I'd much rather do that than get rich by making people miserable, even if making people miserable pays better. 

And if you want me to also farm or build housing or something while making art, I'm 100% cool with that. Plenty of societies have had their artists just as normal hunters, gatherers, laborers, etc. Some have artists as a full time role and I think that's good too. But I definitely don't want to hear about how much everyone else is ""contributing"" when I sincerely believe the world would be a better place if half the US workforce never did another day's work in their lives.

ihy8d4o,poprostumort,"&gt;That being said lets start with money. According to \[this article\](link expunged due to reddit spam filter) a PC with equivalent performance to a PS5 costs 77$ more (I think in practice the difference is a bit larger). But xbox and PS have a fee to play online of 60$ per year.

Let's do the math. MSRP of PS5 is $500. Let's be generous and say that you had to overpay to get your hands on it and pais $600. Online play is $60/year and console generation is 4-6 years long. So maths puts as at total cost over generation at $960. Let's round it up to $1000.

Currently a good $1000 gaming pc would have following specs:  
\- Ryzen 5 5600  
\- 500GB M2 SATA drive  
\- RTX3060  
\- 16GB of RAM

It's power would be comparable to PS5 so it's a tie if we consider current state of things. But when we look from point of view that:

&gt;You will also have to buy a new console every few years if you want to keep up with new game releases, while a PC will be compatible with all games released in the foreseeable future and most games released in the past

We also need to consider how this PC would fare throughout 6 years compared to console. And the answer is unfortunately: poorly.

Console has an advantage that games are directly written to that hardware. More time console has on the market means more experience for devs. And they tend to learn how to push more from the same console. This is not the case for PC. Ports usually don't offer the same level of juicing out components so through time, games will tend to have slowly increasing requirements. For a PC in $1000 price point, it will mean that it will inevitably suffer in performance when comparing the same graphics quality, so you will need to either live with dropping graphics to lower settings or fork out some money for upgrade.

So we have slight win on console side.

&gt;Of course newer games demand more and more performance so in practice you will have to upgrader your PC eventually

So let's consider how it would fare if we would assume upgrade in console budget when new gen hits. Let's look at how $1000 PC from PS4 launch looked:

\- Intel Core i5-4670K  
\- 250GB 3.5 SATA SSD  
\- 8GB of RAM (DDR3 1600 Mhz)  
\- GTX 760 OC

And what can we re-use, what we need to buy. We can stay with this CPU so wea re set with CPU and MoBo. We are definitely need to up RAM to be safe so we need second DDR3 stick, same as currently there  ($50), larger SSD preferably M2 if we have that slot ($60) and new graphics card with power equivalent to 3060 (around $500). so cost of upgrade is already crossing the $600 line and this upgrade will not make this gaming PC live another 6 years, 2-3 at best. After that time you will need to upgrade CPU RAM and MoBo and reuse rest. This would rather eat remaining $400, considering prices of parts.

So it's a tie on money side. But when you compare switching consoles and juggling PC parts to arrange budget well - it's a slight win for console.

&gt;PC has way more games. To such an extent that certain genres of games (are very rare or) dont exist at all on console (rts, moba, indie, gamejam, ect.).

Impossible to compare so it would need to be ignored as it comes down to preferrence. PC has a great backlog of older games, while current consoles have backwards compatibility.

&gt; I would also argue that games are generally cheaper on PC since multiple stores are competing with sales, and because of p\*racy.

And there is no second-hand market which exists on consoles. So it is not really an advantage.

So all in all it would seem that console would win albeit only slightly, right? Well, if you have $1000 budget then yes, it would win only slightly. But if you have $500 budget, it would be a huge win for console as you will still get the same experience with this upfront cost, while it would dramatically slash your PC experience.

And I have been comparing PC to PS5, which is less cost-effective solution. Xbox One X with Gamepass bought on discount would be a steal compared to any $500 PC. I also given PC a headstart by not counting prices of peripherials or system.

And if you have lower budget? sub $400 PC is a piece of crap for gaming. Sub $400 console is a last gen PS4 or current gen Switch/Xbox One S. There is no comparison between gaming experience on those and sub $400 pc.

PC Gaming is superior if you have money for it. For cost-effective gaming, you cannot beat consoles.",2022-07-27 21:28:45,2022-07-27 21:28:45

I don't know much about Andrew Tate in particular, but the online manosphere has a lot of charismatic dudes voicing their opinions about men and women, and I'm more familiar with that. 

I'd like to look at some of your statements one by one and argue why I don't think your conclusions follow.

&gt;Men, should be men.

What does that even mean? Does that mean that, as a man, I need to like football and drinking beer or I'm living life wrong? Do I need to be loud and aggressive even if I don't want to be? Do I need to dress a certain way? If I like wearing dresses, am I no longer a man? Do I need to be heterosexual, or am I no longer ""being a man""? 

My point: there are billions of ways to be a man. And there are billions of ways to be a woman. Saying ""men should be men"" is worse than useless because it implies there are men out there who *aren't* being men. 

**Humans should be humans**: compassionate, kind, respectfull, strong, and vulnerable. 

&gt;I feel as though being a man is vilified through terms like ""toxic masculinity"" or ""mansplaining"" etc.

Why do you feel like ""toxic masculinity"" or ""mansplaining"" is an attack against you? 

Do you embody toxic behaviors that are typically considered masculine? If so, why would you want to continue being toxic? Wouldn't it make more sense to notice ""Hey, I *am* hurting myself and people around me with some unhealthy internalized notions -- I should work on changing that!"" If you don't have toxic notions baked in to your ideas of masculinity (we all do, but let's pretend you don't), why do you feel attacked by the notion of ""toxic masculinity""? 

Do you subconsciously assume that women are less knowledgeable than you and, as a result, talk over women or discredit their opinions? Even when those women might be experts in their field? If so, why would you want to continue doing that? If not, why does the concept of ""mansplaining"" feel like an attack? 

&gt;Women play life on easy mode

I'm going to have to defer to the testimony of women here, since I can't speak for them, but if you think women have it easy, you're trapped in a male bubble. 

Margret Atwood has a great quote: ""Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them."" 

This is true even in the developed world. Even in the United States. If a woman is murdered, it will most likely be by her romantic partner or an ex. 

Every woman has a story about how a man made her feel threatened. Every woman has a story about sexual abuse - either experienced directly, or from a friend. Ask your female friends whether they think they're playing life on easy mode.",2022-07-27 23:59:34,2022-07-27 23:59:34

After getting off, I made a comment about that being scary and she looked confused and said ""But you are a man. Men shouldn't be scared."" Not only is that incorrect, but it is extremely toxic (emotional suppression). Hence, toxic masculinity.

Also, I am a man with PTSD and am unable to work. No car, no house, no ""value"". Only ignorant pricks (like Andrew Tate) actually give a fuck.

My partner accepts me for who I am and supports me in my struggles. We just recently had a child together and we couldn't be happier. Despite society's perceptions of personal value/worth.

The way he talked about his mom in this one video I saw was shocking. I feel like you can tell a lot about a person based off of how they treat their mom. He talks about how his dad cheated on his mom and the way he talks about it, he makes it clear he doesn’t think his dad did anything wrong. In fact, he acts like his mom was dramatic for leaving his dad. If I remember right he said something along the lines of “My dad told me that when I was older I would understand. Now that I’m older I do understand. My dad just fucked another woman. So what?” He goes on laughing about it. While one of his believes is that men should be able to sleep with multiple women, it shocked me that he felt this way about his mom.

ihyqmel,breckenridgeback,"Hi again, OP; we spoke earlier.

&gt; What do I agree with him with? Men, should be men. I feel as though being a man is vilified through terms like ""toxic masculinity"" or ""mansplaining"" etc. Obviously women aswell face the same slander, but I believe men in general have it worse. Women play life on easy mode, especially beautiful women. It doesn't matter if you have 5 kids, fat, drug addict, I can still garentee you can get you some dick and a soda, probably even a long term or life lasting relationship.

Others have already addressed Tate personally, but I want to focus on this bit.

Being a man is not, inherently, a problem. But men are raised, on average, in a way that creates a lot of sexist assumptions, like the one you've listed here. 

No, women do not ""play life on easy mode"". And I'd like to suggest an exercise to prove it. Do you have a deck of cards handy?

Take the 13 spades and the 13 hearts. The spades represent the men, and the hearts represent the women. For simplicity's sake, we'll assume everyone is straight and monogamous, which most people are. Here's your goal: match the men to the women so that (a) women, on average, date someone 'above' them (e.g. the eight of hearts dates the nine of spades) and (b) you don't have a bunch of desirable women left over. You'll find that it is not, in fact, possible to do that.

Can women find a no-strings-attached sexual partner more easily? Yeah, probably; men tend to have higher libidos. But the kind of guy you're going to find that way is not the kind of guy you likely *want* to have sex with. As an example, I've had men approach me and tell me they'd like to rape me. I imagine if I'd said ""oh, sure, let's do that"", I could've had sex. Do you think that sounds like a thing I would particularly enjoy doing or that would end particularly well for me?

---

&gt; Women are more desirable than men.

In some respects. Not in others. I'm a professional and I want to be respected for my abilities, skills, and intelligence - and I've had men *that I was interviewing for a job at the time* disregard all three and lecture me about how I don't really know anything in my area of expertise.

I don't mind someone being sexually interested in me, within reason, but that is *certainly* not all that I aspire to.

---

&gt; In relationship dynamics yes. Women are generally more desirable. 

Did you go do the thing I suggested with the cards? Seriously, go do it, just to prove to yourself that it is literally impossible for things to be as you describe.

&gt; Same reason, I would trust more women to take care of a child. Because generally women are more nuturing.

Okay, and what happens when you're deciding whether to hire a man or a woman for a job that isn't ""nurturing""? Like mine, for example.",2022-07-28 00:43:28,2022-07-28 00:59:43
ihyry2u,distractonaut,"&gt;Women play life on easy mode, especially beautiful women. It doesn't matter if you have 5 kids, fat, drug addict, I can still garentee you can get you some dick and a soda

I can see you've awarded some deltas already, but I'm curious if you've changed your mind on this?

I guess I'm not really seeing how being able to get 'dick and a soda' makes life automatically easier. Sure, I could probably go on tinder and get sex pretty easily, but the likelihood that it will be *good* sex is pretty low if I'm just accepting the first offer that comes along. Plus, the risk to my safety is much higher as I'm physically weaker than most men.

And I'll point out that most guys could probably go on an app and get dick pretty quickly too, if they wanted to.

Can you explain exactly what benefits the average woman is getting? I feel like there is this perception that women strut about getting things handed to them all the time, but it really hasn't been my experience other than the occasional offered drink (that I don't usually accept).

&gt;probably even a long term or life lasting relationship.

Who are they getting into long term relationships with? Wouldn't you say there is probably about an equal number of straight men in relationships as there are straight women?

---

&gt;don't know. Beautiful women have the world at their hands, just because they are beautiful. Handsome men aswell, but you don't really see handsome men getting sugar mommas it's uncommon.

Being a sugar baby is a option for (young) beautiful women, sure, and I have no problem with it. But it is a type of sex work, and involves a bunch of emotional labour and (often) the requirement to have sex with someone you're not really interested in. 

&gt;Beautiful women can go on TikTok, do a little ""EM tO THa BeE"" and now your fucking rich. 

I personally know several very beautiful women, none of whom are rich. Sure, it's easier to get followers if you're pretty but earning an income from being an influencer takes a ton of luck and/or hard work as well. Or you have to be crazy hot. Like, I'd consider myself to be above average attractive but not crazy hot, and I only have like 500 instagram followers lol. 

&gt;You can find a husband that will fly you out, that's rich, now you never have to work. 

While having a rich husband would mean that it's easier to buy things and not have to work, I personally don't consider that to necessarily be a good life. Most of the women I know have jobs they are passionate about, and want to work and make their own way in the world. 

So, beautiful women (generally) have life easy

Beautiful women have the option to be a sugar baby (which they may not want to do) and have the option to try and marry a rich older man (which they may not want to do). I agree that being beautiful can open some doors, just like being really smart or being good at sports can present more options. But those options come with strings attached. Having to sleep with someone you don't like. Not having financial independence. 

&gt;Whereas ""low value"" women can still get validated. So, that helps(?) I'm not sure. Obviously validation can help them full the void of being ""low value"" (low value in terms of mindset aswell). In terms of digging yourself out of this status, I don't know where it would apply. 

I hate the term 'low value' (applied to any gender), but will assume you mean average, non-supermodel women. By validated, do you mean find someone who wants to sleep with her? Does this make life easier? Are there actual, tangible benefits - for example are women more likely to get higher-paid jobs because of being validated? I'm still looking for the reasons life is 'easy mode' for the average woman other than 'people want to sleep with them'.

&gt;Either way, they can always have someone, whether if it's a shoulder to cry on, or through sex. (Generally ofc)

I do agree that women are more likely to recieve emotional support. Unfortunately, men are (still) expected to be more stoic and less emotionally vulnerable, so can find it more difficult to reach out.",2022-07-28 00:28:50,2022-07-28 01:17:24

It doesn't take a warrior, though I'm sure he'd like you to feel that way. In his case, it actually just took some sexual abuse, extortion, unwarranted hate, and a bullshit persona to lure in weak minded &amp; hateful (or young/inexperienced) people.

His mindset isn't *appropriate* for anyone ever, regardless of their opinions and life experiences. Though it may make some perceive themselves in a more positive light or feel better (for negative, incorrect reasons).

Every person on this planet has the potential to be great, good, mediocre, neutral, bad, twisted, or outright evil. Tate chose twisted, and if you see it any other way then you need to reevaluate your morals. 

Financial success does not mean someone is good, honest, or anything. Actually, financial success is often a sign that someone has exploited a large amount of people.

Excuses exist, whether you believe in them or not. As do reasons, which are more concrete. You *just* tried to excuse Tate's awful behavior by mentioning his tough past, so clearly you believe in excuses to a certain degree.

You don't *need* to do anything. I'm smart enough to know I'm not that smart, but from where I stand the vast majority of the developed world is built off of and sustained by constant exploitation of varying degrees.

If your depression and adhd don't interfere with your day to day life, that's great! Unfortunately many others are not so lucky. The problem arises when someone like Tate comes along and starts deciding when other people's reasons are excuses.

A criminal that has done capital crimes is likely only to be released early if they are exonerated.

Like someone else said, when people say that it would be better for someone to remain unborn, they are referring to the potential pain and pleasure that that person would experience throughout their lives, and not to their current state. When the same people advocate for assisted suicide they are also referring to that person's potential for pleasure and pain, and not their current state.

Since the fetus isn't a human yet, we can't apply the same morals we apply to humans, but we can apply the same morals we apply to humans to the future version of the fetus after it's born. If you believe that we should prevent suffering when possible, and there's a high chance that the potential human would suffer immensely after they're born, you might believe that it would be ""better"" for this future person if they were aborted now. This isn't the only conclusion you could reach of course, but it does make sense depending on how you view life and suffering. Notice that with this logic I'm still not applying any morals to the fetus, only to its potential.

For example, let's say you're put in a room with a button in front of you. If you press the button, it will cause an event that will have real consequences on someone else's life for the rest of their life. It could cause them either pain, pleasure, or change nothing, but the chance of it causing pain is a lot higher than the other scenarios, say like 95%. If you have reason to believe this is true, I think most people wouldn't take that chance and would rather not press the button.

ii12esl,Tanaka917,"Self-deprecating (adjective): modest about or critical of oneself, especially humorously so.

1. Making an ass of yourself and self deprecating are not the same thing. One is intentional. The other not so much
2. Not all self deprecation should be reacted to the same. There's a difference between your friend telling you they feel they aren't worth shit and your friend making a joke at their own expense. In one we sit and talk, in another we laugh and enjoy good times. So even if we accepted this was self-deprecating (it is not) it doesn't at all mean that we should treat it in the same category of self deprecation. 

On to your example. The reason this dude is getting called sexist is because his attitude alludes to the idea that women are there for him to enjoy, not for them to enjoy the times. The idea that he gets to insult someone else for existing without being his particular slice of cake is kinda off. He talks as if to say 'women should either be beautiful (and therefore contribute to my enjoyment of the event) or stay home (and therefore not ruin the mood with their ugliness). The women didn't come to the festival to please him and without looking at him I know he's not everyones cup of tea (because no one is). 

He literally puts them on a list with music as if they are another decoration for him to enjoy and not people who are there for their own reasons. It's such a silly way of seeing the world that of course you'd make fun of him.

ii1dqlg,draculabakula,"&gt;Firstly the entire fascination with “rings” started as a way to discredit the greatness of LeBron James. Nobody would ever say Tony Parker is better than Chris Paul, but he has 4 championships.

 I will give you some history.

[https://www.bostoncelticshistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Volumes\_Photos12\_Other\_History\_6-Russell\_Russell\_Bill\_Russell74072185-scaled.jpg](https://www.bostoncelticshistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Volumes_Photos12_Other_History_6-Russell_Russell_Bill_Russell74072185-scaled.jpg)

Before Lebron ever played basketball there was a debate whether Michael Jordan was the best basketball player ever or not. Before Jordan, Kareem Abdul Jabaar or Wilt Chamberlain were most commonly considered the GOAT. The picture I linked was a reminder that there was a player that had way more rings than any of them."" 

So to say that referencing ""rings"" was started to discredit Lebron is nonsense.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Kobe’s “5 rings” are overrated. He played with a top 10 all time NBA talent Center, in his prime that averaged 35/15 in the finals. He even got a ring averaging 15ppg like a roll player. Kobe is an all time great guard but his Finals performances are looking funny under a microscope 🔬

Overrated how? Yo**u never gave an example of what you are responding to in terms of hw people rate him.** I don't think anybody would ever say he is the best SG of all time but nobody should say he is not it the top 3.

Keep in mind Kobe won two titles without Shaq. Kobe stans like to discredit Pau Gasol but Kobe was still very obviously the leader of that team and the main reason why they won. In 2009 Kobe average 32 pts, 5 rebs, 7 assists in the finals. 

**During the 3 peat, the centers Shaq matched up against in the finals were a washed Rik Smiths in his last season, a 34 year old  Dikembe Mutombo, and Todd Maculloh**. Only Dikembe is a respectable match up and Shaq didn't play as well in that series. He was still great but hopefully you get my point. He wasn't playing peak players. The year before, when the Spurs were healthy, Shaq and Kobe got swept.

**Also, you are doing the same thing to Kobe as what people do to Lebron.** Keep in mind that when Lebron went to the Heat, it wasn't enough for him to be on the same team as a top 5 all time SG and a top 3 at the time PF. They needed to bring in a bunch of more talent to win. When the Cavs beat the Warriors, it is considered the worst officiated series of all time, and when Lebron won in 2020 with the Lakers he greatly benefitted from the shortened season and the bubble. 

**My point here is not to discredit Lebron or Shaq but to point out that you can make a case against any superstar.**",2022-07-28 13:33:38,2022-07-28 13:33:38

ii4sxcr,SeldomSeven,"As the saying goes, ""there's a lot to unpack here"". 

I don't know much about Andrew Tate in particular, but the online manosphere has a lot of charismatic dudes voicing their opinions about men and women, and I'm more familiar with that. 

I'd like to look at some of your statements one by one and argue why I don't think your conclusions follow.

&gt;Men, should be men.

What does that even mean? Does that mean that, as a man, I need to like football and drinking beer or I'm living life wrong? Do I need to be loud and aggressive even if I don't want to be? Do I need to dress a certain way? If I like wearing dresses, am I no longer a man? Do I need to be heterosexual, or am I no longer ""being a man""? 

My point: there are billions of ways to be a man. And there are billions of ways to be a woman. Saying ""men should be men"" is worse than useless because it implies there are men out there who *aren't* being men. 

**Humans should be humans**: compassionate, kind, respectfull, strong, and vulnerable. 

&gt;I feel as though being a man is vilified through terms like ""toxic masculinity"" or ""mansplaining"" etc.

Why do you feel like ""toxic masculinity"" or ""mansplaining"" is an attack against you? 

Do you embody toxic behaviors that are typically considered masculine? If so, why would you want to continue being toxic? Wouldn't it make more sense to notice ""Hey, I *am* hurting myself and people around me with some unhealthy internalized notions -- I should work on changing that!"" If you don't have toxic notions baked in to your ideas of masculinity (we all do, but let's pretend you don't), why do you feel attacked by the notion of ""toxic masculinity""? 

Do you subconsciously assume that women are less knowledgeable than you and, as a result, talk over women or discredit their opinions? Even when those women might be experts in their field? If so, why would you want to continue doing that? If not, why does the concept of ""mansplaining"" feel like an attack? 

&gt;Women play life on easy mode

I'm going to have to defer to the testimony of women here, since I can't speak for them, but if you think women have it easy, you're trapped in a male bubble. 

Margret Atwood has a great quote: ""Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them."" 

This is true even in the developed world. Even in the United States. If a woman is murdered, it will most likely be by her romantic partner or an ex. 

Every woman has a story about how a man made her feel threatened. Every woman has a story about sexual abuse - either experienced directly, or from a friend. Ask your female friends whether they think they're playing life on easy mode.

---

&gt;Generally I feel women have it easier. In terms of relationship dynamics.

Thanks for the delta, but I'd like to take a look at this idea again. 

How are the demographics of the two populations 

* Single heterosexual men who are seeking a loving, respectful relationship
* Single heterosexual women who are seeking a loving, respectful relationship

different? 

Are they different sizes? No. In most places, there are roughly as many single heterosexual men as single heterosexual women. 

Do a greater proportion of men want a loving, respectful relationship than women? No. I'm guessing roughly the same proportion of single men and single women want a loving, respectful relationship. If anything, I would guess that more women want that than men, so it should be *easier* for men to find a woman seeking a loving relationship. 

In your OP you wrote:

&gt;It doesn't matter if you have 5 kids, fat, drug addict, I can still garentee you can get you some dick and a soda, probably even a long term or life lasting relationship.

Is ""dick and a soda"" really the metric for success in relationship dynamics? Is she having good sex that she enjoys, or is it just a job to prop up her drug habit and feed her kids?  Is that really what you consider aspirational? *Life on easy mode?* 

If this hypothetical woman does end up in a life-long relationship with a man, *then the man is in a life-long relationship too!* If it's a good relationship, that's an equal number of men and women who have found a good relationship.  

If you're thinking ""Nah, he's stuck in a relationship with this undesireable woman..."" - what kind of lifelong relationship is it if your partner doesn't even like you? You think she doesn't notice that he doesn't respect her? How is that ""playing life on easy mode""?

**Bottom line: If your standards for success are low, then success is easy. If your standards for success are high, finding a good relationship has always been hard for everyone.**

---

Hey, thanks for engaging with me on this. I feel like I've written a lot and I appreciate you taking the time. 

&gt;Women are more desirable, they're free to pick and choose and will always have an option. Men on the other hand have to bring something to the table to become desirable.

What makes you think this is true? 

Are we talking about long-term relationships or hookups? Maybe men are less picky when it comes to hookups, but I suspect that has more to due with the imbalance of risks and rewards between men and women (see Marget Atwood's quote) and cultural attitudes about women hooking up. 

When it comes to long-term relationships, women have to bring something to the table too. Or do you think that men just have lower standards and are like ""I would marry any woman who will have me""? 

Even ***if*** we assume that men have lower standards than women, what good does it do you if you're a woman looking for a meaningful, long-term relationship? What's the difference between having zero options and have one hundred options if all one hundred options are bad? ""So, Steve doesn't actually care all that much about me - he was just happy any woman gave him attention. We have very little in common and he mostly regards me as a feather in his cap, but I get to spend his money so I'm happy!"" is not what the vast majority of women aspire to. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So women have it easier to get a partner, because they are more desirable, because they're prized and ""rare"".

Again, this is literally, statistically not true. The supply of women and supply of men is roughly equal. If women can't find someone who meets their standards, they remain single - same as men. Given that most long-term relationships are monogamous, it's statistically impossible for significantly more women than men to be in long-term relationships at a given time. Like, how do you imagine this works? 40% of men are single but only 10% of women are single? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's why OF models make millions of dollars, why women more than men go viral on social media, or a rich guy can just swoop by and you no longer have financial stress and etc.

Now we're talking about a narrow subset of humanity. ""Pretty privilege"" is a thing, but it applies to men too: people who meet the beauty standard are - all other things being equal - just going to have it easier. 

Being a trophy husband is a perfectly viable career path for hot men too. But snagging a wealthy benefactor isn't really what most people call ""success"" when it comes to long-term loving relationships. And most women aren't going to be able to swing by the local watering hole and pick up a millionaire. 

&gt;Even looking at this from an evolutionary standpoint it makes sense why these things are the way they are. Women have to bare children, nuture them etc, men do not. So it makes sense they would want to pick and choose their partners optimally towards their needs. So naturally the strongest men, the ones that have the most to offer will pass on their genes.

I mean, first of all, a lot of women don't want children, right? So, where's all this evo-psych entering the equation for them?

But barring the fact that this evo-psych is mostly pseudo-science, it's not like men are immune to evolutionary pressure. I could just as easily argue that women have it harder than men because men just want to pump and dump whereas women want a long-term caregiver and these conflicting evolutionary goals are inherently incompatible. 

Reality isn't that simple, of course. Men *aren't* simply sex-crazed and afraid of commitment. Women *aren't* simply looking for the biggest, strongest, richest monkey in the tribe. Men *and* women desire meaningful relationships. Men *and* women like attractive people. Men *and* women enjoy sex. Men *and* women want their partner to boost their social status. Men *and* women want safety and security. Men *and* women want to love and be loved. Men *and* women hate online dating :)

---

&gt;Women don't understand the burden of performance.

Citation needed. I don't believe this.

*Some* women might not understand *the specific burdens that men* *experience*, but that's a far cry from your claim.

&gt;In evolution, if men didn't perform women AND men died. Men have to provide, if they didn't they're monkey wife and kids would starve because women are weaker than men.

First of all, we're not hunter gatherers on the African savanna anymore, right? Sure, human beings are influenced by our evolutionary heritage, and biology is still relevant to human experience, but there are a *gazillion* things about human life that are not biologically determined and I would argue that culture is one of them.

Second of all, your claim about primordial humans is not true - or at least paints an incomplete picture. Sure, if men sat around and did nothing, that would be bad, but the same is true for women. Or do you think that the women in hunter gatherer societies don't have jobs beyond popping out babies? Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that hunter gatherer societies are more egalitarian than agrarian societies.

**Bottom line:  Women need to perform too.**

&gt;""Men aren't simply sex-crazed and afraid of commitment. Women aren't simply looking for the biggest, strongest, richest monkey in the tribe.""  
&gt;  
&gt;That's generally how it is though. I don't think anyone can deny that.

I deny it. I claim most women would prefer a meaningful relationship to a trophy husband. I claim that both men and women generally like sex and are generally hesitant to make life-altering decisions (although it's highly individual).

&gt;Women don't have to work towards sex, or towards a partner.

Yeah they do. Look back at your OP. You described the stereotype of an undesirable woman: fat, five kids, drug-addicted. That implies there are standards. Do you think women are unaware of the expectations men have for them? Do you think stereotypically desirable men are lining up to wife that stereotype of an undesirable woman? Do you think a typical woman will be happy in a relationship with a man who doesn't value her ability to increase his status?

Talk to women. Ask them what expectations society has of them. Ask them if they think they don't have to ""perform"".

&gt;Men nowadays have nothing to add,

Sweeping generalization without evidence.

&gt;they don't have to work for sex anymore, they have porn.

Sex and porn are not interchangeable and no one thinks they are.

&gt;All their instincts and primal urges are suppressed by shit food, diet and no exercise.

&gt;Testosterone levels have hit an all time low.

[Testosterone levels aren't something you need to worry about as long as you're otherwise healthy](https://youtu.be/C8dfiDeJeDU?t=599) (3 minutes of video from linked point).

---

I think we're getting bogged down in specifics. I feel like you're throwing out a lot of specific claims about reality that I doubt are true. For example,

&gt;Which testosterone is what makes a man a man, that's a fact.

That is *absolutely not* a fact. Even if we're talking about biology, it is waaay more complicated than that. 

So, let's take a step back and look at the things we **agree** on: 

* Men and women both face social challenges associated with being their respective gender. 
* Some of these challenges are new -- unique to our current era of history 
* Neither men nor women should be put down for or held back by things beyond their control  (such as being a man or being a woman)
* People should help and support each other
* Gender roles exist
* There is nothing wrong with adhering to a gender role if that's what you want to do
* However, people shouldn't be forced to adhere to specific gender roles and they shouldn't be shamed for differing from the norm

The crux of our disagreement is, I think, the following points:

*  You think gender roles are a good thing for a functioning society. I think they are unnecessary and cause as many problems as they solve. 
* You think that the solution to the social challenges men face is to look back to the past. I think that you overestimate how stable the past was and underestimate how much suffering the enforcement of gender roles has had. 
* You seem to think that men and women are who they are because of biological reasons. I think that most of the differences between male and female psychology are cultural and that culture is framed by biology, but not determined by it, and that men and women mostly want similar things.   

Did I miss anything important or misrepresent anything? 

You also seem to be trying to find a model for men to follow that will make them happy and healthy: 

&gt;Being a ""man"" is a lost art. I put quotations because ""man"" is subjective, but what I'm referring to is the stereotypical ""good man"" but the ACTUAL ""good man"" not the stereotypical ""bad man"" - if that makes sense?

So, what do you think about this claim?

*What is virtuous - that is, the right thing to do - is the same for both men and women.*

---

Yeah but there are always those things. In 1978 (the year before Montana was drafted) they made it so the defender couldn't touch the receiver after the first 5 yards. The league average instantly went from 300 yards a game to 400 and rushing immediately started becoming less common. 

In Jordan era they losened restrictions on traveling.

Before he played,  Wilt always dunked the ball for free throws since high school and they banned it when he entered the league lesson him without knowing how to shoot free throws. They also widened the land because of him. 

If you take rule changes into consideration you can't ever compare players from different eras because they aren't playing the same game.

---

My point was that making it so CBs couldn't touch the receiver after 5 years made it much easier for receivers and QBs. Before the rule change every defender was allowed to ""chuck"" (essentially run intoa hard as they wanted without knocking the recurve over) exactly once whilr the receiver was running their route. This meant that a safety could come up with the ball was in the air and hip check the receiver.

You can see how much easier it became to complete passes down field after the changed that. 

In the late 1990s, they made it illegal for players to hand check in the NBA. This made it much easier for small weaker players to score. In the early 2000s they made it illegal for the defender to crowd the shooters landing zone. In the early 2010s they defined the gather step which essentially gave the ball handler an extra step without having to dribble. All these things directly allowed players like Steph Curry and James Harden to be successful. It's safe to say that without those rule changes Steph Curry wouldn't be half the player he is. He would get pushed off balance before his shot, then he would get called for a travel for his double step back three, then he would get injured when he landed on the defender who just walked right into his landing zone.

The dead ball era ended in 1920 when the MLB made it illegal to lick, spit on out Scuff the ball and they made it so the game used multiple balls per game instead of just one. In 1919, the year before the rule change, Babe Ruth broke the record with 29 home runs. The first year of the rule change he hit 54. The year after he hit 59. At the end of the 1930 season,  10 players hit over 35 home runs in a single season.

There's a million things like this.  In 2003 (Lebrons first season) the league changed the playoffs so the first round is now best of 7 instead of best of 5. Before 1983 the first round was best of 3. Some how Lebron owns every playoff total stat category even  though there is are players like Jordan, Kareem, Duncan, and Russell who all had more titles than him. They also changed the way the seeding worked early which made series go longer by having better teams play earlier in the playoffs in Lebrons career and they went from 4 divisions to 6.

Some folks might think that -- but believing that there is a bubble certainly doesn't require the belief that the bubble comes from the same cause (rampant speculation and over-easy credit).

&gt;There's still a huge inventory problem, a general lack of new homes being built, corporations and foreign buyers buying up ridiculous amounts of real estate. To disrupt the lack of inventory new houses would need to be built in a time where no one wants to buy and you can't find enough contractors.

For the long-term trend, that's absolutely true -- population is increasing steadily, and if housing does not increase at the same rate, it will be appreciative. But the long-term increase in prices is *not* what people mean when they talk about a housing bubble.

&gt;No one who bought a house in the last 2-5 years is going to be stupid enough to sell right now, not when interest rates are 6%, if you're locked into a low interest mortgage you're going to keep it, unless you're in a situation where you're forced to move.

This is certainly true -- and if the skyrocketing price of housing were primarily due to a sudden, massive spike in population, this exacerbating factor would surely keep prices high.

Here's the thing, though: the skyrocketing price of housing in the last three years **is not due to a massive spike in population.** It's due to a massive, *temporary* spike in demand for single family homes.

* Since 2000, the population has had a compound annual growth rate **of 0.7%** (from 282 to 329.5 million).
* The [US inventory of housing units](https://www.statista.com/statistics/240267/number-of-housing-units-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20housing%20units,amounted%20to%20140.8%20million%20units) has increased from 120 million to 141 million (coincidentally, a CAGR of 0.7%).
* Here's a view of median housing prices since 2000. The compound annual growth rate 2000 to 2020 was 4.95%, which isn't explained by the above.
* So what's going on? It's not landlords, and it's not vacant houses due to speculative investment:
   * In 2001, 88% of housing inventory was occupied (according to the US census dept). In 2020, 89% was occupied.
   * In 2001, 65% of housing inventory was *owner* occupied. In 2020, 66% was owner occupied.
   * So the compound annual growth rate in the share of housing inventory being rented out is utterly negligible.
*  However, consider these factors:
   * The new housing construction in the last 20 years has been 1/2 has likely to be in multi-dwelling units, while averaging 1.5x the square footage, as housing construction in the preceding 20 years.
   * Population growth in major urban centers has outstripped rural and suburban-rural population growth by a factor of 4x -- but *that isn't where the houses are being built,* because they're overwhelmingly large, single family homes.

OK -- so that sets the stage. The chronic issue is due to a mismatch between the inventory being built (single family homes are the most profitable for builders, and multi-unit housing has seen a dramatic decrease in share, inflating prices). While rental properties and speculation have an effect, they have an effect on **local markets** \-- in other words, they can exacerbate an existing lack of housing.

So what's going on recently? Well, we have seen a CAGR of 16% in housing prices in the last two years. Population has increased negligibly; owner-occupied share has not budged; vacancies have not budged. What gives?

**It's a bubble.** A sudden spike in the demand for *single family homes* combined with a temporary cratering in demand for multi-unit dwellings. That's a COVID effect. All of a sudden, you don't have to live right next to your job... you've been cooped up at home and want a yard ... etc. Combine it with initially extremely low interest rates, and a ""bigger fool"" mentality, and you've got sky-high prices.

The vast majority of homeowners *didn't* buy their homes within the last 2 years, and will be able to sell them for more than they bought them for -- but not for 2022 prices. The folks who bought their homes since mid 2021 will  take a bit of a bath, but only if they need to sell before 2030 or so.",2022-07-29 09:28:17,2022-07-29 09:28:17

ii5qvgu,badass_panda,"&gt;Well, let me just say: to me, that sounds like the result of desperation, more than greed.

The willingness of young men to *fight* a war is not the *cause* of the war. If you posed the question, ""Why do soldiers most often go to war,"" I'd guess the answer would boil down to some mixture of pride, duty, friendship, and naivete, followed by 'desperation' far in the rear.

At the same time, most wars are *not* spontaneous combustions of desperate young men attacking one another for resources; they are organized affairs, with leaders at the top who are doing most of the decision making.

These leaders, however, are rarely starving -- having obtained a position of power, it is unlikely that they are desperate in any literal sense.

No they took it because of his vision. His vision issues are caised by old age but old age isn't the reason. If his vision had fallen below acceptable levels for *any* reason the exact same measures would have been taken.

The important thing, however, is just because seemingly preferable alternatives existed, doesn't mean the localizers had any grand agenda beyond getting the product out the door and fast.

-thought it would appeal to their potential audiences, including uptight religious households. 
-thought it fit the animation itself better
-they care little for the source material and see no trouble with wholesale changes (e.g., Macross/Robotech)

ii7z50p,Otspic,"Come on, you are really pushing it here. OP never said she got involved in a high speed chase, just that she followed him for while. You have no idea what the time of day was, the location, any witnesses, or if cameras were around. At least she actually knows who hit her now, depending on the above that might have been impossible.

Police really dropped the ball and she's right to be pissed, it's for a court to decide leniency, not the attending officer. Especially since its a criminal offence and OP was physically injured.

---

In what scenario does a prosecutor get involved? OP says the officer understood the other driver to be at fault for a hit and run causing injury to OP.  But the officer recorded it as a minor parking incident in a different location. No mention of the other driver fleeing the scene or injuries caused. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you expect the cop to admit to falsifying the incident report? Doubtful to think this is going anywhere on the police's initiative without OP kicking up a fuss.

---

As a starting point I think you need to give OP's comments more weight. She says the officer told them the reasons for not recording a hit and run, so generally that should be believed i think, but you are right in that we only have one side's version. And as you say, OP should follow up with the cops to get a report if she is concerned.

I think our main disagreement is the outcome we consider fair. I'm not after punishment for punishment's sake, but, regardless of age, the other driver ran red light and left the scene of an accident. The driver could have easily killed a pedestrian instead of crashing into OP. This type of driving needs to be reasonably penalised (I'm not advocating for locking up a 75 year old) and also accurately recorded. It shouldn't be a purely monetary exchange via insurance for repairs, medical etc.

---

My bad, I probably should have said at the outset that I don't think the other driver should necessarily be permanently banned for just these two offences, but they should at least be put on notice of a potential licence suspension for repeat offences. 

Not sure if you would prefer to only use insurance price to respond to driving offences, but there are a number of problems using this approach imo:

1. It only really works for people with less income. People with more cash will just be slightly annoyed when the bill arrives..
2. its (usually?) a yearly payment and the price varies due to a huge array of factors. There's little feedback to the driver about the actual cost of the offence, which might have occurred months before.
3. sends a somewhat mixed message imo, that engaging in risky driving can be compensated by paying more. This is true in a financial sense for the insurance company as other customers average out the risk. But the company's financial risk does not directly translate to real world safety.
4. Generally, I think if people are driving on public roads funded by tax dollars, the rest of us should not have to tolerate drivers who disregard the rules. Insurance companies didn't decide that red means stop and green means go - at some point the government needs to be able to enforce its own rules and say varying degrees of 'gtfo' to those who abuse the road system",2022-07-29 13:54:37,2022-07-29 21:32:00
ii8wzeu,gothpunkboy89,"&gt;I have found very often, that when a view is presented in an argument,   
many people seem to focus their attack on the argument itself instead of  
 the actual substance of that argument. I think it may be helpful to   
give an example of this:

&amp;#x200B;

Some times the argument it self is the issue.  I could create an entire argument why gynecologists should be allowed to finger bang their patients during exams, but no matter what reasoning I pull out to support that idea the basic idea is that they should be allowed to sexually assault their patients.

&amp;#x200B;

So people will go after that part because what ever reasoning I gave is irrelevant to the fact I am quite literally advocating for sexual assault. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Then you have other times were the core of someone's argument is based around faulty arguments such as circular logic or appeal to the popularity.  You see this a lot with video games were people will use popular opinions and treat it as hard facts. If I had a dollar for every time someone tried to use appeal to popularity as their primary defense of why they think ME3's ending is bad I could afford a new car.   The popularity of an idea doesn't mean it is correct it only means it is popular. Yet they use the popularity of an idea to mean that it is absolutely 100% correct and arguing against it is meaning less because it is like arguing that gravity doesn't exist.",2022-07-30 04:42:03,2022-07-30 04:42:03
ii92a0g,themcos,"&gt; If you had two people, and both had the exact same childhood, education, and quality of life growing up, but one decided to become religious and one did not, I believe the non-religious person would be the more intelligent one.

I'm trying to puzzle through what you're actually saying here. If you just mean this as a *prediction*, I'm probably inclined to agree. I think a more intelligent person is *less likely* to turn to religion. But I don't think that actually gets you to your view, which is that a person who is religious necessarily *is* less intelligent.

And the main problem is that ""intelligence"" is a very complicated property that probably can't be condensed into a single quantifiable attribute at all. And similarly, the reasons why someone might turn to religion (or turn *away* from religion) are similarly complicated.

But if a religious person is better at math and better at chess (or whatever other stereotypical ""smart"" stuff you want to throw in), would you really say they're necessarily smarter than an atheist who is bad at all that other stuff? Probably not. But like I said, I think there is a weaker claim that is more likely to be true that intelligent people are more likely to become atheists, but this isn't the same as saying that atheists are ""automatically"" more intelligent.

And I'm not even that confident that that weaker principle holds across the board. To talk about upbringing situations, I think one issue might be that you're looking at this backwards, and thinking about whether kids ""become religious"". But if in the quoted bit, the shared upbringing that you're holding constant is highly religious in nature, the kids in question might start from a baseline of heavy religious behavior. And from this baseline, the highly intelligent person might find tremendous positive social feedback from their religious community, while the less intelligent counterpart might struggle in a lot of ways and have a harder time fitting in with their community, in which case they might reject their community and *turn to atheism* not because of some set of reasoned principles based on intelligence, but more out of a rebellious streak and then not fitting in with the religious community for social reasons. In such a situation, it's easy to see a filter that acts in the opposite of your intuition, where the more intelligent kids get embraced by their community in a feedback loop that reinforces their religious upbringing.",2022-07-30 05:37:11,2022-07-30 05:37:11

But you'd be ignorant to simply dismiss **all** arguments for theism as complete nonsense.

There's a reason some of histories smartest individuals have been religious or even people of the Church themselves.

So I guess my question is do you think arguments such as the Kalam, first principles, teleological arguments, argument from consciousness, argument from morality. Are all simply foolish ideas that only idiots would take seriously? Or can you at least admit that even if you don't find those arguments convincing yourself that there is a lot of nuance and thought to those arguments that could lead very intelligent people to find them convincing?

---

&gt;However, I would say those people are not as intelligent as people who do not argue

Do you mean people who don't engage with religious debate full stop or people who argue for atheism/agnosticism?

&amp;#x200B;

If it's the former, I'd say not engaging with one of the most important philosophical questions in our lives would indicate that someone is probably less intelligent. To simply ""not care"" about a question that really defines our world view doesn't scream ""enjoys think critically"" to me (although I admit this is somewhat of a generalisation but I hope you get the point).

Where as I find it much more understandable for people to think and **care** about these questions. Whether these questions lead someone to theism, Christianity, Atheism, Islam, Buddhism or whatever I'll admit that the people that put **time and effort** to **think** about these questions and come to a conclusion are from my experience usually a lot brighter and sharper then the types of people who ""don't care"" or who base their worldviews off of emotional reasons whether that's ""I'm X religion because that's what my spouse is"" or ""I'm an atheist because my parents were super religious"".

I'd argue that **how** people come to theological conclusions often says a lot more about their intelligence that **what** their conclusions are (most of the time).

---

&gt;Would you not then say that these types of people are less intelligent? They are basing their worldview off of emotional reasons, either from childhood beliefs or influence from parents or fear, and not off of their own research and understanding of the world?

Yes I would. I just believe that it goes **both ways**. 99% of positions should be based on **logic** no **emotion**, or at the very least the emotion shouldn't **override** the logic.

My view is simply that people can be religious or atheist/agnostic for reasons that are both **logical** and **emotional**. That it's possible to be religious for reasons that are logical and atheist for reasons that are purely emotional.

I'd argue that the type of person who is religious because they find proper theological arguments or historical evidence convincing in most cases will be more ""intelligent"" than someone who is atheist because ""that's what scientists believe"" or some other wishy washy reason.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And, if they are the type to question theology but still choose to believe in God, there must be a reason they are able to stick to that belief with what seems like a vast amount of evidence stacked against them. In my opinion, it has to be willful ignorance which to me is less intelligent than accepting the world as it is, without influence from an old book!

I don't mean this the wrong way, but I read this and doubt that you've looked very thoroughly into some of the more well thought out and convincing arguments for God's existence. There are quite a few very good arguments that can give people good reason to have confidence in God's existence.

For example take the argument from motion/causation. I'm sure you'd agree from basic observation alone that everything has a **cause**. The reason that laptop/PC/Phone is in front of you is because you picked it up and moved it there. Before that it got to where it was because you bought it from the store, it got there because it's materials were mined from the Earth, they got there because they used to be apart of asteroids, and those asteroids used to be apart of stars etc etc.

The argument goes that you keep going until you reach a point where there is something with the property of being able to cause things without being caused itself. We would generally give this attribute to God.

Some people rebut that point by saying ""there is no cause"" which sounds rather ridiculous and hardly convincing. While other's rebut it by saying ""there's no first cause it goes back **infinitely**"", which is again not much of an answer and doesn't make much sense since infinities don't really exist in reality.

Regardless of whether you just found that argument convincing can you see how perfectly logical and intelligent people could choose either conclusion as valid? If you can then wouldn't you have to agree that religious people can be just as intelligent and justified in their views as atheists?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm really interested in your last sentence. I think I agree with you there, could you expand a bit more?

I think it applies to many things. Just because something is **objectively true** doesn't mean that the reason people know that is because they are smart or they apply critical thinking. Plenty of people believe things that are true by luck or without thinking much about it, and that in itself isn't really a sign of intelligence or critical thinking skills.

For a (totally fictional) example let's say it's **objectively true** that a guy called Epstein and his rich friends have sex with underage girls on his private jet and island.

Now two people come to this conclusions. One does it by researching into Epstein and trying their best to get first hand accounts from some of his victims.

Another comes to the conclusion because they hear it briefly mentioned on Reddit and because they really hate rich people in the government they automatically believe it to be true.

Both of these people's conclusions are **correct** but in terms of intelligence and critical thinking skills which one do you think is lacking in those departments?",2022-07-30 04:29:38,2022-07-30 06:47:10

I'm assuming you're American, but these stats are generally true for every modern country.

&gt;Unwanted pregnancy

Condoms are 98% effective when used properly. Failing that, you can take Plan B. Failing *that*, you can have a first trimester abortion, which is an out-patient procedure. To actually have a child you don't want is insanely difficult. I rather bet on you winning the lottery. There are at least 3 fail safes against it. Condoms are also just one part of it. You can double up by using a condom and IUD if you're really scared.

&gt;STDs can, quite literally, ruin a person's life

What STD ruins a person's life? Syphilis and Chlamydia are minor and treated with a pill that clears them up in a week and then they're forever out of your body.

Herpes has no cure and is life-long, but it's also not a health risk. It's so harmless that doctors don't even check for it when you get a full STD testing done. They recommend against testing for it because the social stigma far outweighs getting three pimples on your genitals for 1 week, every other year. In fact, there's a good chance you already have herpes. 11% of Americans have genital herpes, and about 50% have oral herpes. Herpes is also treatable if you're supremely unlucky and have frequent outbreaks, via a pill.

Even for HIV, only 0.3% of Americans have it, and those that do live lives on par with those who don't via treatment (usually a single pill a day).

It's sad because by far the worst aspects of STDs aren't the diseases themselves, but the social stigma around them. This stigma is often fueled by simple ignorance of STDs.

&gt;i would worry constantly

I've talked about how the risks aren't as risky as I think you're painting them, but we also need to look at the cost of your viewpoint. Denying yourself sex is massive. Abstinence just isn't realistic, does more harm than good, and there's no good reason for it. Sex is amazing and we shouldn't deprive ourselves of something that's safe and natural. Especially since we can do it while taking precautions. Sex releases oxytocin, which builds greater bonds between people. It's extremely difficult to only have a pure friends with benefits. Those sound great, but rarely work out. People can't help but get attached and catch feelings. That's the power of sex, and why should we be denied it until we're in our what, 40s? Most people don't have their career down until mid-life. That seems crazy to me. You don't think so?

You're right there is a risk, but it's absolutely tiny relative to the rewards. We take so many more risks every day. Risking crossing the street. Making an expensive purchase when you could lose your apartment or home to a fire the next day. Choose a college major that turns out to not be your passion. Eat some food that could make you ill via food poisoning or an allergic reaction.

Risks are a part of life and you need to do a smart cost-benefit analysis to decide whether one is worth it. I think 99% of reasonable people would agree sex, when done with just a little care, is worth it.",2022-07-30 07:20:20,2022-07-30 07:20:20

You might know the answer is right, or wrong, and *you too* could be mistaken about that. Their reasoning could be *valid* in fact, if examined closely.

Not all arguments that appear fallacious actually *are*. And certainly not all arguments that *appear* valid are. Examining the *argument* is the only way to tell whether to believe the arguer.

Doing some rough math, I've been engaging in sex for 20 years. I've had regular sexual partners for most of that time. When I have regular partners I tend to have sex 2 or 3 times a week.

I have had zero pregnancies and I am STD free.

But consider a situation where the two main parties are both bad in that neither want to meaningfully improve the status quo, but also, neither want to make the status quo substantially worse. Further, imagine that the lesser evil party in this case does want some improvements, but they're simply not enough. 


Now imagine there are third parties that do want enough change. In this case, voting for these third parties is actually useful en masse, even though they won't win and will likely be spoilers for the lesser evil.


What can happen is that lesser evil party loses the election, and then realises the demand for third party participation in the democracy. Importantly tho, they also realise that almost all of these third parties are more likely to work with them than with the other major party. So for next election, they make a promise; if we win, we will appoint an election committee that will look into how we can make a fairer democracy that ensures people have local reps, but also allows minority party engagement in democracy. People obviously like this, so they vote for this party next election and they win. This party can now either follow up on their word, or risk never winning an election again for blatantly lying (Justin Trudeau is immune to this because of how terrible Canadian Tories are). So they implement election committee, and bam, now they have MMP instead of FPTP, and there's no single party majority for 20 years


If this sounds oddly specific, it's because it is. It's literally what happened in new Zealand, and it happened because people were willing to vote for not lesser evil.

iiam6q1,zRexxz,"The only reason the third option ""has no chance"" is **because** we choose not to vote for it.

Like, this is the problem with the argument here. People say you shouldn't vote third party because it 'doesn't have a chance' but the only reason it doesn't have a chance is directly **because** of the presumption that they aren't going to win and so no one votes for them.

It's a self-fulfilled prophecy is what I'm saying. It's the very mindset that these parties don't have a chance that **causes** them to not have a chance. We create the lack of chance by choosing not to vote for them in the first place.

If we didn't have that pre-existing belief against third parties and weighed them equally in our options compared to other parties, it's very well possible that they could have much greater of a chance than they currently end up having. But the fact that we assume they have no chance causes their chances to be lesser than if we assume they did have a chance.

So basically, if your argument is: ""third parties don't have a chance"". That's why the solution is **vote for the third party.** Because that's how we increase the chance of the third party winning. I too, believe that third parties ""don't have a chance"", so thus I choose to vote for the third party to increase their chance (albeit slightly, by one vote).

Obviously me voting for the third party alone isn't going to increase its chances far enough to change the tide of the entire election. But I don't blame that on the third party being an ""unviable option"". I blame that on the fact that I'm one of the only few people who seem smart enough to realize the whole ""self-fulfilled prophecy"" that everyone else is getting duped into. If everyone else realized it too, and recognized that it's only our voting patterns and beliefs against third parties that's determining whether the third party has a chance of winning or not, then we could all come to the conclusion ""Hey, technically *any* option has a chance of winning as long as we all vote for it"" and then we all do the smart move which is to vote for the third party and then it actually **does** have a chance of winning. That's really the crux of the problem here.

In short, the ""third parties aren't going to win so why vote for them"" mindset is a logical paradox. We create the problem that we end up criticizing third parties for. We shape the outcomes, we shape the very notion of ""which parties have a chance and which don't"" with our vote.

My mindset when voting is, I'm going to avoid falling in the trap that everyone else falls into. Maybe if enough people catch on, it can spark some kind of gradual shift in how we think about voting. But if you guys want to doom shit by saying ""the third party isn't going to work"", so there's a split vote between the third party and the ""lesser of two evils"" and thus the ""greatest evil"" ends up winning, that's on you guys. It's everyone else's collective stupidity that led to the ""greatest evil"" winning. I'm not going to walk on eggshells by changing my voting patterns to compensate for the fact that everyone else is an idiot when it comes to voting. Imo, it's up to the population to realize this entire thing is simply a consequence of how they choose to vote and their bias against the third party in the first place.

If people really want the ""greatest evil"" not to win the election - the ""lesser two of evils"" logic can apply the opposite way. If people really want to prevent the ""greatest evil"" from winning, they can join me in voting for the third party. I don't get why the sole solution is me changing **my** voting patterns to compensate for everyone else’s stupidity. Everyone else can change their voting patterns to support the third party just as I can change my voting pattern to support the lesser of 2 evils. It's not the ""third party"" that's the problem - it's everyone else's stupidity in thinking that the ""lesser of 2 evils is the only way"" that's the problem.",2022-07-30 12:46:27,2022-07-30 12:46:27

iiasgue,Gladix,"I think you entire argument hinges on very specific sets of semantics that do not change the truth of the matter, but merely how you talk about it.

It's like saying : 

1, I do not believe milk exists. And therefore it's literally impossible for the cheese to exist.

2, Wait, so you don't believe the cheese or milk literally exists? So this yellow block I'm holding in my hand right now, what do you call it?

1, It's obviously an aged version of the secretion that cows make, rich in protein and fat.

2, Wait, female cow secretion rich in protein and fat. You literally just defined milk.

1, Did I? What about soy milk? Or coconut milk? Are they the secretions of cows?

2, Well, no.

1, See? Milk doesn't exist!!!

You see, these two people are talking about the same thing. One just refuses to use the words that society uses because of some personal idea that words should somehow be pure. You are doing exactly the same thing.

&gt;I think society has such rigid standards on what constitutes man or woman / masculinity or femininity, that when someone falls outside of what society defines as being masculine or feminine they may feel compelled to identify as the opposite sex.

Yes, gender is a social construct. 

&gt; This usually leads to the victim developing resentment towards the physical features that are unique to their sex. It makes sense because if they did not have those physical features (in other words, if they were not a member of that sex) then they would be able to express themselves without backlash from society.

And yes, this disconnect between what one ought to identify as and what one does identify as is causing them undue stress and suffering. Nobody is disputing that. The only thing what you and the society disagree at is the label by which you should call these people.

&gt; If people were accepted for who they are they wouldn't feel the need to undergo surgeries and hormone treatments.

Perhaps. Let's grant all of this as true. Let's assume there is no pure bodily dysmorphia involved in regards to trans people. And let's assume the problem is entirely psychological. A combination of social conditioning, trauma, ostracization, etc...

Assuming all of this is true. Does it change anything? Because these people still experience an undue stress and suffering and no other treatment seem to be effective. If the only viable alternative to hormonal therapy, surgery and whatnot is changing the ENTIRETY OF SOCIETY. How could you treat those people, if you prohibit trans care right now? Because even if we assume that we can change the entirety of society, it won't happen overnight. And until then what other option for transgender people is there?

Because like it or not. The current medical intervention is the only effective treatment we have. And yes it relies on changing the people's bodies in a radical way to conform to the narrow categories our society created over it's millennia of existence. And yes, perhaps an androgynous society is both possible and better. But we are not there, are we? And people still experience a very real problem, right?

&gt;Transgenderism is the result of failures on both the right and the left.

iiazt81,budlejari,"It comes across as it's more important to be accurate than to listen to someone else's feelings and validate their emotion at hand.

And that's rude. 

If we are in a science setting, and being accurate about the number of men who did x versus not, it would be valid to correct your coworker to say ""not all men did x"" because that might impact the research. 

But if someone is upset and unhappy about something that has happened to them and they are venting by saying ""all men suck!"" listening to them and seeking to understand what they mean when you tell them ""not all men?"" or are you prizing being technically right over their actual need when it makes no difference to you in that moment? 

A lot of this is about *nuance* and *timing*. 'Valid argument' implies that there's a back and forth. Butting into someone else's venting to impose a technicality on them... not so much. Being right is a good thing. Being right *all the time* by forcing yourself into a conversation that didn't need you to invade to correct one small statement when it's highkey unnecessary is borish and rude. 

Edit, since lots of people are taking this to the nth degree because I didn't add any limits on it, which I should have done. That doesn't mean that you should let this stand *forever*. It doesn't mean you shouldn't point out the sexism, or racism, or whatever. But it means you should *pick your time* and consider the situation *before* you make this into a ""you said a bad thing and I'm disappointed in you"" moment. You should consider how close you are with the situation, the person, and whether your contribution will help or whether it will come across as pedantic and dismissive of the actual issue in an effort to be more right than the other person. 

If someone is mad that they just got broken up with and they're losing their home and they're angry and crying about it to their friends and you're just a classmate with no emotional involvement - not a good time to turn this into a teachable moment and you're not benefitting anybody involved here. Save it for later, when the other side is calmer and more open to listening. If they're just complaining about a server who forgot a dish, that's a good time to bring it up and point it out in the moment.  

This is where the *nuance* and the *timing* part comes in. Pick your moment, the way you convey this, and the actual take away you want them to have.

Edit 2: I turned off all inbox replies because wow, there's a lot here. But, long story short, I've made some edits since people don't seem to understand what this means.  

This post *explicitly* responds to the 'not all men' issue, and the fact that OP states it's a *valid and appropriate* response to other people venting about a patriarchy issue involving men. It *explicitly* responds to the argument that saying not all men is more important because being right the highest priority. It challenges the OP by suggesting that it's more important to listen to the issue, the speakers, and the context of the discussion before formulating a response that also challenges the sexism inherent in such statements like ""all men are trash."" 

It is *directly* about producing a conversation that will change people's minds and decrease the likelihood of repeating the behavior rather than making people feel invalidated and like the only thing you care about is being technically right or defending men in a situation where men are the perpetrators of violence, harm, or negative things at the expense of the women involved. 

It is not a defense of bigotry, it is not a 'women can be sexist and men can't' issue (women can be sexist about men) and it's not a 'women can say whatever'. It's not that women must never be challenged quickly and forthrightly about sexism. 

This is where the nuance comes in.

It's about understanding that being right isn't the most important thing in a conversation *in this specific set of circumstances* and if you want to actually challenge sexism, you can't hyperfocus in on a tiny aspect at the expense of everything else in the conversation. 

Intention does a lot of lifting here, *in this specific set of circumstances* on both sides, and if the goal is to challenge sexism, you gotta be willing to open the door and have a conversation, even if you don't like what they say, not roll in with a tired, memed out old line and then get mad when people don't respond to it well.",2022-07-30 14:27:14,2022-07-30 14:27:14
iibco4p,IAteTwoFullHams,"&gt;So Christian faith explicitly states that killing someone is against its rules, if I'm correct it's number 6 on the Christian commandments.

This is not correct.

First of all, the commandments are never actually numbered. Moses says ""Here are the Ten Commandments"" and then he proceeds to say about fifteen different things. Different Christian traditions group them together differently.

But more importantly, Exodus 20:13 does not say ""thou shalt not kill."" Because it's not in English. It says thou shalt not ""retzach.""

What did ""retzach"" mean to Jewish tribesmen living in 950 BCE? It's not actually totally clear. It's used in a variety of ways throughout the Old Testament. And the meanings of words can change drastically within a single generation - I've seen it happen to quite a few words just within my own lifetime.

But there are Biblical scholars who think it's pretty clear that the closest possible translation to ""retzach"" is ""murder."" (Though there are some subtle differences. Like in English, a lion would not murder a deer. But apparently a lion can retzach a deer.)

Because even in the Torah itself, there are commands to kill people. Like Leviticus 20:1-2. ""The Lord said to Moses... any\[one\] in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Molek is to be put to death. The members of the community are to stone him.""

So, are we to believe that God said to Moses: ""People must not kill each other. Also, people must kill anyone who makes a child sacrifice to Molek""?

Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?

But in Leviticus 20, God doesn't use the word ""retzach."" He uses the word ""môt."" Which basically means ""to make dead.""

So apparently you can't retzach, but you can môt. That ought to clear it up, right?",2022-07-30 16:06:35,2022-07-30 16:06:35

iibprjb,Weasel_Cannon,"I think it’s important to understand *why* someone is offended, not just whether they are or not. Let me know what you think of these examples:

“I am offended at your use of the air conditioner” - sounds silly. What if they are offended because they are conscious of the climate and energy usage, and are upset because some people keep the ac on 65 degrees, then wear sweaters and sit under blankets to stay warm. If you’re cold enough to need a sweater and a blanket, then you are wasting energy and harming the environment. Is this person now justified in being offended by air conditioners?

“I am offended by people who eat meat” - nobody wants to hear the vegans shame their eating habits, but in reality many of the sources of our meat are inhumane and filthy. Can we spend more to get “responsible” meat? Sure, but with inflation as it is many people simply do not have this option. Perhaps there is a better way to treat animals and/or our bodies, but is the person justified to be offended that you are directly contributing to the inhumane treatment of animals?

I’m arguing the title of your post, because even if you don’t care as much or at all about the things people are offended by, there is almost always a reason someone feels offended. And, since no one person is the arbiter of “justification”, if someone feels offended then they are absolutely justified in feeling that way. Does it mean they automatically deserve an apology? Not at all. Literally nobody has to care about it. But if they have a reason to feel offended, then they *are* justified in feeling the way they do, no matter how paltry it may seem to you.",2022-07-30 17:52:34,2022-07-30 17:52:34
iibr4ru,GoodLaughh,"Yeah this probably the best response. I see what you mean. I’ll say that this response changed my my view. 

My only thing is that your examples are those that don’t impact ones life. Or their income. Like for instance, the AC example. That’s something somebody could argue about and their lives just go on to the next day. When someone says they’re offended and feel somebody is transphobic, this is an entire different ball game. You’re now in the realm of potentially taking food off of ones table. Stripping away opportunities that one may have worked all of their life for. This is where I feel it’s wrong and there needs to be something that addresses the offended party. Now if what offended somebody is something that’s clearly wrong, then yeah they should get what’s coming for them. But if it’s just something like a joke that can be views similar to the vegan example you gave, why should one have to suffer just because of a simple difference in opinion?

iibyci8,PmMeYourDaddy-Issues,"&gt;So, the European system of governance (parliamentary or presidential) does not really work in a society which isn't European or neo-european unless they also start thinking and behaving like Europe.

Neo-European? What does that mean? 

&gt;Here, by Europe, I mostly mean western Europe, not the eastern Europe.

So the European mindset doesn't even apply to Europe? 

&gt;This way of governance is very much dependent on the European way of thinking.

What is that way of thinking? 

&gt;Since then, the more a nation tries to develop, the more it tries to copy the European way of living (for example, monogamy, dismantling of the kin or clan system, western way of education, and others).

Monogamy is an inherently European concept?  

&gt;I am not saying that these things aren't good, my point is that for good or for bad, these ways of living came out of Europe.

Did they?

---

&gt;Monogamy was practiced nowhere in the world (at least not by any big society, and here when I say society, I mean Societies of Eurasia and North Africa, the societies which are considered to be civilized in the traditional sense since the ancient times).

That's fun you just get to disregard any counter-example you don't like. Except you know the fact that Babylon and Assyria existed. And Egypt. And Ancient Israel. All of those societies had monogamy as a norm for all but the most powerful men. 

&gt; However, after the catholic Church came to power, it started ensuring that nobody marries or more than one woman at a point.

Ahistorical nonsense. 

&gt; And yeah, it is a European concept, China introduced monogamy in the 1950s, India did too after independence but only limited to Hindus, it finally passed the same laws for Muslims in 2015.

You seem to believe that China, India, and the Muslim world represent the entirety of non-European society. 

You also never defined what Neo-European means.

---

&gt;I am not disregarding any counter-example, I have mentioned this in reply to another comment that I am considering the societies of Eurasia and North Africa only because the societies in these places developed in the kind of societies, which are usually considered ""civilized"". By that they mean that these societies used metals heavily in their civilization.

Metallurgy isn't unique to Europe. 

Plus all the examples I gave were from Eurasia and North Africa. 

&gt;As per your ""ahistorical nonsense"", I'd suggest you give a read to the book I have mentioned in my post, and you can find all the historical proofs about how it was actually a policy of the Catholic Church.

Monogamy existed in both Greece and Rome before the Catholic church existed.

---

&gt;You have to understand that in a most polygamous society too only about 20 percent of the men married more than one wives. A polygamous society isn't what people usually think that every man has more than one wife.

So most polygamous societies weren't even that polygamous? Doesn't seem like you're making a great case that it's unique to Europe. 

&gt;Furthermore, not sure about Greece but in Rome at least, men did have relationships with more than one woman at a point.

They did not marry multiple women. Adultery exists in every society that has the concept of marriage. 

&gt;Yeah men couldn't marry more than one woman at a time, but they were having many women as de facto wives.

You ever been to France?

---

&gt;In Europe, the aristocracy and mobility practiced polygamy which was stopped by the Church. So Europe is unique in case that it was the first society where even rich and powerful men too can't have multiple wives.

So just to be clear, despite Rome and Greece directly disproving your position, you're claiming that the Church stopped the powerful from practicing polygamy, though they could still practice adultery and maintain multiple mistresses, and that's somehow proof of anything? 

&gt;Not sure what you mean by ""You ever been to France"".

There's this thing with French people and mistresses. 

&gt; They had adultery, not polygamy. 

Yep. 

&gt;And that is from where the Catholic Church drew its stand on monogamy. 

No, the Catholic church drew its opposition to adultery from the 7th commandment. Which by the way was revealed to Moses in Eurasia, not Europe. 

&gt; I'm sure you know that Catholic Church came into existence in ancient Rome, and after the fall of western Rome, when most of Europe returned to a clan way of living, the church still maintained the policy of monogamy and later spread it to the rest of western Europe.

So the Catholic church spread the teachings of a Semitic religion which spawned in Eurasia to Europe and you think this is evidence that Europe created the concept of monogamy and therefore only European societies can handle democracy?",2022-07-30 12:09:42,2022-07-30 19:03:07

You keep using the phrase 'better than a human'. Are you aware that art is subjective, and that intentionally 'bad' art can and is frequently very popular?

What Berserk covers are you talking about, by the way? A quick google search shows nothing.

iicuejx,PreacherJudge,"&gt; With AI art and AI scriptwriting like DALLE and AI dungeon, proof that AI can already construct art just as well, if not better than humans, there is no reason for a company to hire a worker over a machine.

This is obviously untrue.

What I think you mean to say here is that these tools suggest that at some point in the future, AI will be able to make art as well as humans do.  I'm concerned here, though, because it's very hard for non-experts to talk about hypothetical future technology that might not ever exist.

You are also ignoring that the fun of things like DALLE and AI dungeon is that they're in the uncanny valley, which is what makes them weird and funny.  They're close enough to what a human would make, but they're also extremely stupid and they swerve in unexpected ways.  VERY few people go to them for anything but amusement.

&gt; No one will go through the trouble of hiring a graphic designer or artist when AI can instantly generate pictures, concept art, game portraits or scripts for movies.

You're not appreciating the tradeoff of randomness and coherence.  To an AI, creativity is just randomness, and because of that, it's very hard to get them to be creative in a way that makes any sense.  Human curation helps some, but that brings in its own problems: the rules of creativity being *crowdsourced* will pretty much by definition keep creativity from being anything at all.

iicuw7y,teamfun411,"Many art jobs can’t be replaced by AI yet. Animation. 3D modeling. Rigging. Lighting. VFX animation.  Photography. Film editing. Storyboarding. 

I can see AI being used to replace illustration jobs for articles. But a lot of places that would do this are already going to just use stock photography. 

AI can do early concept art, but at a certain point concept art needs to be refined so that it can be actually built, and AI software can’t do any of those final steps. Maybe there will be fewer concept art jobs because this software makes it much faster to make concept art. But… a bulk of a production studio isn’t concept artists. 

House of Cards was not written by AI, it was written by people. But decisions early on in its process were made by AI, like choosing a star and choosing a director. This isn’t replacing artists, its making decisions that executives make. 

And a problem with AI writing so far is it doesn’t understand things like subtext, metaphor, or symbolism. I also think this stuff is bad at writing really long form stories that are coherent. At this time it can’t seem to do things like build complex characters, and then keep those characters consistent through a story, or give them arcs.

Treating certain groups differently is very reasonable in many cases. You are presumably approaching this from the perspective of unjustified prejudices, like viewing all black people as criminals.

DALLE2 can rock at creating generic images. Yes, if someone wants to commission a teddy bear riding a rainbow on a skateboard, DALLE2 will give you exactly what you want for a buck.

But... Maybe I'm wrong, I'm not an artist, but I think people who pay for commissions are generally looking for something more specific. [Example](https://twitter.com/edgemintapps/status/1553330429641490432) of me trying to create fanart of a specific character. Yeah, I got generic mother nature designs, but [not even close to the target](https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Ceres_Fauna?file=Ceres_Fauna_Portrait.png).

Yeah, but “with enough improvement” is quite a vague term.

I’m not saying you’re definitely wrong - maybe DALLE2 is our “AlphaGo beats European Go champion” moment - AlphaGo was superhuman roughly a year after that.

So, sure, it’s *possible* that Dalle puts all artists out of business in a year’s time.

Or maybe it’s like self-driving cars. There have been semi-working prototypes for oh, the last decade or so, but we’re still not at production ready full automation.

It's like comparing train and car automation. Trains are much easier to automate(and automated train systems already exist) because you're going along well-defined routes with well-defined conditions and the list of possible screw-ups is much more limited.

iiczzul,budlejari,"&gt; Why then couldn’t we set aside some of our innovation brilliancy to shaving off those last few hours of everyday manual labour?

We have. The difference is that there is not enough *demand* for it in homes to drive the cost down and therefore make it affordable. The technology already exists in industry - clothing factories do already wash, iron, fold, and sort by machine but they do so because there is high demand and low variety. They exist in places like laundrettes for hospitals, where they get sheets, curtains, gowns etc, and similar items with little differences. The average home does what... 3-5 loads of washing a week of maybe 50-150 lbs of laundry over them all, spread over 7 days? A factory does *hundreds of tons* per day and each stage is done by a unique bot that is specialised to the task. 

In a home, that would be wasted. A machine that only sorted socks, for example, would get maybe 20 pairs a week? How is that economical to run? 

What you're asking for is a *general purpose robot* that automates multiple processes and that, my friend, is much much much more difficult. How hard should it scrub for linen? For lace? For sexy lingerie versus general purpose boxers? How should it handle folding bras versus crop tops of different weights? A coat? A sports kit? Each different iteration of a problem needs tailoring and a decision tree and different factors weighing in. It needs a multitude of skills and each one has to be better than a human to make it worth it to pay that kind of cost. It has to have fail safes and to know what to do in every situation that it might come across, such as ""I found a pen in this pocket. Do I put in the machine or not? What about a bobby pin? Rocks? Paper? Ink cartridges? A mobile phone? Coins? A live animal?"" 

That's the problem. We already have the technology that does this but a human is faster, cheaper, more accessible, and easier to store in the home than any robot you could create to handle all these problems.

---

The things you requested are already here: 

&gt; Washing machines wouldn’t require a bunch of time and effort spent sorting clothes.

Cold washing, colour fast dyes, and wash and go synthetics have basically made sorting most clothing a breeze and given that washing machines need to fit into a small space, sacrifices have to be made. 

&gt; Dishwashers wouldn’t need every grain of rice scraped off before you put your plate in.

This is a weirdly American issue. Not sure why. Never done this in... 20 years of owning a dishwasher? 

&gt; Toilets wouldn’t often get clogged and could flush down almost anything.

Toilets are not generally the problem in flushing everything - if they are, it's because they're 40 years old or... trees, which is just a byproduct of nature. One cannot stop nature, no matter how hard one tries. Sewers, on the other hand, are problematically picky, and that's often because sewer systems are usually decades old, if not centuries. Fatbergs are, unfortunately, an occupational hazard these days.

King sized quilts, baseballs, bike/car parts, the non-waste shit that we found that got flushed down the toilet is wild. And there’s 2 ways it got there A.Flushed down a toilet/washed down a sink. B. Someone waded through knee deep sewage to put it there.",2022-07-31 10:14:11,2022-07-31 10:14:11
iiethpp,I_am_the_night,"&gt;If a sexual and aggressive drive is more prevalent and potent in men, who have each in turn put themselves in iffy situations as I have, it seems to me to point to a call for restraint and, sometimes in my case, a fear of unleashing the beast. Either that or an understanding by both parties that restraint is an option that may be preferred.

And 

&gt;So I suppose my case is to be careful what you wish for and specify in what form it should be done, because from personal experience there are legitimate feelings in men that are best left unsaid.

I don't really understand how these describe a conflict.  Even if men are, on average, more sexually aggressive or have higher sex drives, this in no way conflicts with a movement encouraging men to be more emotionally expressive.  In fact, teaching men to express their sexuality and aggression in healthier and more respectful ways is exactly the kind of thing people are talking about when they say they want to teach men to be more expressive.

Not only do these issues not conflict at all, movements encouraging men to be more emotionally expressive and sensitive are actually a great way to address toxic sexual attitudes and unhealthy expressions of sexuality.",2022-07-31 11:27:34,2022-07-31 11:27:34
iiez0j5,masterofyourhouse,"I don’t understand why you’re equating emotional expressivity with aggression and harassment. Being emotionally expressive is not the same as letting your emotions control you. It’s about giving your emotions a healthy space to be experienced and acknowledged. Encouraging men to communicate when they’re feeling upset, depressed, etc. in no way has any bearing on their likelihood to be aggressive or harassing. If anything, I would say it might even decrease that likelihood because aggression can often be the result of suppressed emotions exploding all at once.

---

There are appropriate forms of emotional expression and inappropriate forms. We teach toddlers that having tempter tantrums is inappropriate, and that there are other, healthier ways of communicating their needs.

Similarly, if sexual harassment and aggression are inappropriate ways of communicating how you feel, and they are by no means exclusive to men. Women can be aggressive and sexual harassers as well, but it is not a societal norm for them like it is for men. When people encourage men to be emotionally expressive, it means talking to their friends and close ones about how they feel, or going to therapy. Not touching people who don’t want to be touched.

---

Yes, I am saying that the reason why sexual harassment and aggression are so much more prevalent in men is because our society enables and reinforces that kind of behaviour, and that it is not inherent in manhood as opposed to womanhood. 

Also, going back to healthy vs. unhealthy expression: in both cases you are expressing your emotions. It is just the way in which you do it that is important. It’s a very common idea in therapy that there is no such thing as a “bad” emotion. How you feel is just how you feel, and it’s how you respond to that that’s important. Either way, it’s important to acknowledge your emotions and give them space, and simply experience them, rather than bottling them up.

Aggression is a manifestation of emotion, not an emotion itself. The emotion may be anger, and instead of being aggressive, you could vent to someone about how angry you feel, punch a pillow, etc. And while sexual attraction isn’t an emotion, there are plenty of people on a daily basis who feel sexually attracted to people without harassing someone. You can just think “oh, they’re attractive”, and move on with your day. Because most people don’t pursue every sexually attractive person they meet. 

As for reinforcing behaviours, it’s all about what society deems permissible and impermissible. In terms of sexual harassment, rape culture is predominant, and creates an environment that is conducive to men harassing women, whereas women’s sexuality is repressed. And in terms of aggression, traditional masculinity is strongly associated with that. The whole concept of the “alpha male” is contingent on that kind of aggression.",2022-07-31 11:21:59,2022-07-31 12:05:54
iif6t8y,breckenridgeback,"&gt; But would you agree that aggression and sexual attraction are forms of emotional expression that should be publicly suppressed?

No. There are other ways to express attraction than harassment.

&gt; I am only claiming that aggression/sexual drive, which are seemingly particular to men, get an especially bad rep when expressed publicly.

You do realize women like sex too, right? And in fact actively seek it out sometimes?

---

&gt; I am saying that we should respond to some forms of sexual expression in a different way than simply labeling them as harassment and shaming the person doing the action.

Okay, and which forms of sexual expression are those?

---

&gt; yes, you're trying to get me to say intrusions in the form of sexual harassment. Haha you're so smart with your Socratic method.

I'm asking you to state what forms of expression you think can't be achieved without harassment. The fact that you're getting defensive about that does tend to make me think that is what you mean, though.

&gt; The forms of sexual expression that I'm talking about are compliments/statements that may be somewhat uncomfortable but have not yet reached the level of harassment, which would be continually doing this despite the obvious discomfort of the receiver.

Can you give a specific example of such a statement? The ones I can think of are things I don't think anyone really has a problem with.

&gt; She does not discuss it with him because she is concerned with how he would respond.

This is the key line.

If Sharon didn't have to worry about retaliation, or ""why are you making such a big thing of this"", this would be less of an issue. But her boss has direct power over her career and her financial security. Even if this were a co-worker, it'd be a bit problematic, but it's *much* more so when there's a power asymmetry: Sharon's boss is - whether he means to or not - applying pressure to Sharon to accept or at least not reject his advances for fear of repercussions.

The problem isn't Sharon's boss expressing something. The problem is the power dynamic.

&gt; Sharon instead goes to HR and reports her boss for sexual harassment (I am not sure if this is even possible, and if not maybe you can enlighten me) despite the fact that she never made it clear where she stands.

Sharon shouldn't have to ""make it clear where she stands"", because any manager worth their salt should know this creates a bad power dynamic that both (a) is a terrible way to run a workplace and (b) opens you up to legal action. Were HR aware of this behavior, they would put a stop to it with or without a complaint (at least if they're remotely doing their jobs).

Expression *in the workplace* is generally subordinate to maintaining the working relationships within it. I have co-workers that I do not like and that I would very much like to tell to shut up once in a while. I don't do that, though, because a workplace relationship necessarily has different dynamics from a private relationship in that we're all trapped in the same room together five days a week.

&gt; Let's say Billy goes to a party and attempts to hit on a very attractive girl. That girl, not finding Billy attractive in the slightest, scoffs and turns her back on him, giggling with her friends. Billy gets angry and says that she should at least give him a chance.

Billy has gotten a pretty clear ""no"". Admittedly a kind of mean one, maybe meaner than necessary, but it's a ""no"". Pushing when you have gotten a ""no"" isn't expression, it's insistence.

&gt; A proper response to this expression of sexual attraction may better have been ""sorry, I'm just not interested"" or ""not looking for anything tonight.""

Sure, the object of Billy's attraction here was pretty mean to him. But that doesn't absolve Billy himself of pushing after he got a ""no"".",2022-07-31 11:32:08,2022-07-31 13:02:05

Its obvious the character in the song wants to better understand thier lover.

My personal interpretation of the first line is “It doesn’t hurt me….” …to tell me what you truly think/feel.

Why is it so hard to communicate this with each other? Its the barriers between us.

If only we could swap places and actually feel how each other does, we would ynderstand in a way beyond words.
