2. Again, consequences are natural. Positive or negative are subjective. If you jump off the empire stage building, you’ll fall. That consequence is natural and it’s called gravity. Positive or negative is subjective. If you’re a child rapist and serial killer, I’d argue that consequence (you falling to your death) is positive. If you’re a saint and worked tirelessly to end world poverty, I’d say that consequence (you falling to your death) is probably a negative consequence. Pregnancy is the natural consequence of sex, whether it’s positive or negative is entirely subjective and shouldn’t be the basis for murdering a human life. 

3. Got it. I can see the logic in that. Point taken! 

4. So you’re agreeing with me that there are many ways to avoid getting pregnant and that it is harder to get pregnant than it is to not get pregnant. You just proved that there are options (other than abstinence, which is fool proof) to avoid getting pregnant.  

I think abortion proponents would have a better chance at getting everybody else on board with their stance if they stopped trying to convince the world that a) abortion is not murder, b) the thing that is being aborted is not a human life, and c) abstinence doesn’t help prevent pregnancy. Those are all facts that the abortionists try to argue around like they’re debatable facts. 

I think a better argument for an abortion proponent would be to agree that abortion is the active ending/killing of a human life (the fetus), however, the mother is also a human life and her life is more important because she sustains the other’s life. With such a strong argument (which is rooted in scientific evidence), the other side would be faced with the burden of proof of determining whose life is more important and why? That will be a hard task because the value of one’s life over another is rather subjective. So who ultimately decides whose life is more important?

It's a logical position to prevent the institutional murder of ~ 1 million humans.  It's an emotional argument to say: ""fuck all of those humans, I don't care about murdering babies.""

You answered the question yourself- there's no real quantifiable differences between a human life and an STI to you? If that's the case, so be it, but I think I see where the issue with your morals are then..  Do you or do you not believe their is a difference between a human baby and an STI?

In the case of an STI, you are eliminating a disease, a virus, etc- from the body.  In the case of abortion- you are murdering another human.  If you don't see the difference between the two- then again, I think we all know where the issue is.

Again- you are using your own manifestation of the argument, to turn me into a religious person, to then justify making a religious argument, which you then try to dismiss.  It's a strawman.

I'm telling you in no uncertain terms: 99% of biologists (and 1% who are so politically motivated and/or shouldn't have gotten their degree) will agree that a unique human life begins when a sperm and an egg merge.  Many don't or choose not to answer the question because it paints an uncomfortable picture for them to talk their way out of.

Stopping the process prior to a unique human life being formed is 100% fine by me. Take contraceptives, use condoms, etc etc- but if something fails, etc- then understand that once you create a new unique human life- you don't get to just murder that life.  That's not a personal moral philosophy, its an argument back by science.  Once a unique new human life is created its not ""unheard of"" ideal that we are restricted from killing or murdering other humans. Again, if you believe in the right to kill other humans, then I think we've found where the disagreement comes from- but society at large generally does not allow for the unrestricted killing of other humans.  Again- to the extent that you practice your beliefs and I practice mine- ""and no one is harmed"" I have no issue with- the problem is- again, you are killing another human.

If I choose to go murder someone because they are making my life harder, can I tell you to shut up and go away, they were limiting my full potential in life? We all know the answer to that... And society has an intrinsic and invested right to minimize murder of other humans.

As to your second paragraph.  I see you've bought into the ""doomer"" manifesto and that's your opinion on the coming world.  Congratulations, you made a value judgement on the future.  That still does NOT give you the right to kill another human.  If you don't want to bring a child into this world (fine), and take precautions to prevent that from occurring (fine), but rhen they fail- you don't get to them kill the child (a problem).  Furthermore, your misguided understanding of the future is informing your choice to kill that child.  You have a pretty inflated view of your ability to see the future- and killing your child, because of what you *think* might happen 10-20-50 years from now is just more pandering...  You have no clue what our future is going to look like- it will certainly be different, but they claimed the sky was falling back in the 20s and the 50s and 60s too etc- point being: you don't have the right to murder your child because you've become sold on a ""doomer"" fantasy.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

This is a societal question. This is what we're trying to decide. The option is open to us as a society to say that although a pre viability fetus is technically a human life, it is not granted legal protections until later. We put age limits on the exercise of other rights as well.

&gt;How could you possibly ""middle way"" this?

How? Like I just did above. We decide it as a society.

&gt;And who will judge that abortion is ok? Because for self defence we have lenghty trials..

Reasonable question. In my case I would probably just make the doctor sign a statement about the reason for the abortion. I know that he could lie on the form and I know that will be pretty common. But I'd be willing to deal with that because I agree that making someone prove they were raped to get a late term abortion is not a good solution. The burden of proof would not be on the woman to prove she was raped. If it was somehow later proven that the doctor knowingly lied on the form then he should face consequences.

It's far from a perfect solution, but nothing is perfect. I'd be open to other ideas. 

&gt;And the argument about self defence is irrelevant, because someone attacking you has the option not to do so, and stay alive. 

&gt;And legally you can use force only if nessecary, you cannot shoot your mailman because he entered your property, and then claim sefldefence. Since a birth has high chamces of survival for both, killing the baby cannot fall under this logic..

Another thought on this debate is the quality of life a baby might have if the mother is forced to give birth. My mother, a therapist, counselled ppl that adopted an unwanted baby that had many behavioral problems. Only cause of problems was being unwanted *in utero* bc baby was adopted at birth. Other unwanted kids that are kept by mother do not get a 'good' childhood, most have hurdles to overcome in order to be considered contributing to society. Many have addiction and criminal issues that are a drain on society.  We have more than enough abu$ed and neglected children, why force more on society, when the same RTLers don't want to spend their tax $ to fund social programs that help those problems?

""A well regulated militia being necessary for the protection of a free state"" is and was considered a prefatory phrase that explains why the right of the people to bear arms shall not be infringed. The right to bear arms was ruled to be an individuals as well as the right to form a militia and train without government interference. This type of prefatory clause was common in the 18th century and was meant to clarify and add to the following statement not BE the primary statement. Bruen further established that the right to bear is not just for the home but extends out of the home as well as determining the type of legal analysis that must be used when determining what restrictions are placed on arms. The point of an amendment is to protect that right FROM the government and from those who wish to remove that ability. 

The civil liability is meaningless after this ruling bc while you could make the argument it bypasses state law, it would literally be unconstitutional to make that law in the first place. At this point A LOT of laws are going to go down. The entire foundation of gun control was using intermediate scrutiny or means/ends analysis and that is now considered unconstitutional. Any laws attempted (or even those already passed) must pass the test of does it infringe on the right to keep and bear arms and is there historical evidence of similar/comparable laws passed from the 1780s-1850s. What is left after that is objective licensing with reasonable conditions like background checks/passing a written or physical test, sensitive area bans (which are limited and required to be rare exceptions, not the rule), and bans on dangerous or unusual weapons. Now dangerous in the context of weapons is EXTREMELY relative since weapons are by nature dangerous. So dangerous would mean AT MOST it's normal use is hard to control to the point that it endangers the person legally using it as well as other non involved parties. Unusual has already been ruled on bc stun guns were ruled ""common"" when there were only about 200k in the country. So outside of death rays, bombs, biological/nuclear/chemical weapons, and freaking sharks with lasers on their heads it's hard for any ban on anything else.

&gt; For the sake of argument let's say it was the right decision for the organization but the people at the bottom will necessarily suffer as part of it. 

Why is it necessary? What situation is justifiable that it makes the core staff’s lives worse?

&gt; The decision is complex, and the average janitor or w/e doesn't have all the pieces to fully understand the decision, 

Why is this your assumption? 

&gt; all the janitor knows is his life is getting more difficult and it's apparently Mr Executive's fault. 

What else can be expected? The only information given is that ‘we’ve made a decision that will make your life worse, and we’re not telling you why.’ 

&gt; There simply isn't opportunity for Mr Exec to explain it to everyone so they can understand 

Why not?

&gt; On top of that some people don't care ""why"", they're just emotionally upset because of the hardship placed upon them. 

Why do those who *do* care have to miss out on the reasoning/understanding just because some don’t?

&gt; their assessment of the working situations they and others are a part of are bad assessments. 

They’re assessments of how it affects *them,* not *bad* assessments, and by your logic even if they were it’s not their fault, because they’ve had information withheld.

&gt; Since they are bad assessments, their conclusions, recommendations for how to fix, and activism in general are not going to result in a thriving society where work is optional. 

Again, this is an assumption.

&gt; Being a janitor is nothing to be ashamed of, but it's just unlikely an average janitor will be able to wisely judge the exec's decision making.

If being a janitor is nothing to be ashamed of, why are you insulting the intelligence of janitors by saying they wouldn’t understand the decision making? Why not give them the information, and if they don’t understand anyway that’s fine, but to work off the assumption that they *won’t* just because they’re a janitor is the exact type of elitism and arrogance that pushes people to this type of movement.

You’re falling into the trap of assuming that the workplace is a meritocracy. It’s not. Just because someone is on the bottom rung doesn’t mean the person on the top rung is smarter, or works harder, or has more value or ability. There’s an insane amount of reasons someone isn’t higher up the ladder. Maybe they don’t want to be, or they couldn’t afford university and couldn’t get the necessary degree, or they had an illness that halted their progression, or they need to raise kids, or thousands of other reasons.

Your whole argument here is based on the idea that those in the antiwork movement don’t understand higher level workings of a corporation, and you have no basis on that. We do. That’s why we’re angry. Because if my company told me tomorrow my hours were being hiked up and my pay cut, I would know that’s because profit margins are dropping, and the first thing that’s sacrificed is my well-being. That is never okay. 

The whole idea of laziness is massively overblown. Toxic work culture says that you have to do your best, all of the time. But why? The types of jobs you’re talking about here pay fuck all. What reason does a company have to expect stellar performance when they’re not paying stellar pay? It’s common knowledge that people are willing to work harder when they’re rewarded better financially. This idea of ‘laziness’ isn’t lazy staff, it’s staff working at the level they’re getting paid. If I’m getting paid $10 for $20 of work, why should I put more than 50% effort in? Sure, it might piss off my colleagues who do put 100% in, but that’s *not my fault.* it’s the fault of the corporation not paying *any of us* our value. This idea of ‘letting the team down’ is a coercion tactic to squeeze the last bit of labour from staff through guilt, and it’s manipulative.  Especially when the executives make decisions that make the workers lives harder instead of their own.[The average CEO made **351** times the salary of the average worker.](https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2020/) That means that the average CEO could cut their pay in half, and give **351** lowest level staff member a **50%** pay rise, **and still make well over 100 times the average salary for their staff.* But, the workers will always be to ones to feel the pinch, and the pinch for a low level worker is that they might lose their home, whereas the pinch for the CEO would be having to seek a yacht. 

We’re not lazy. We’re disrespected. Why should we give our company our respect when we get zero in return? They’re not doing us a favour, we’re doing *them* a favour. Any company would collapse without low level workers, no matter how good their execs are. Workers are the *foundation* of a business, and a treated like dirt. Why *wouldn’t* we be ‘lazy’?

To combat this idea that the movement will fail, though - it’s no different from all the labor movements that got people the protections they have today, and they said the same thing about those movements. It’s the same old morale crushing ideas, but now we have much easier methods of communication to reach out to others in similar situations to us, which gives us much more emotional backup to fight for our worth. If we have millions of people all cheering each other on, the wind in our sails won’t run out anywhere near as quickly. Plus, internet communication means that we can collectively pool together our resources and input regardless of the industry or company we work for. Whereas before you could only really share the message and movement between your colleagues in the same work as you, now those barriers don’t exist. It’s also *much* easier to find out information about how these companies operate now than it ever has been, so even if someone ‘doesn’t understand’ how these corps work, they can learn very easily if they want to.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

If they marry 10 people, they will be taxed at the same marginal rate as someone who makes 100,000 a year. Same with immigration marriages. It opens up the potential for people to run scaleable businesses exploiting loopholes in marriage laws.

I think the question should be *when* is it okay to describe someone by their race.

In my opinion, and this may sound obvious but hear me out on it-- it's okay to describe someone by their race *when their race is relevant*.

The problem is you have to do some real thinking to discern when that is.

In your example of the ""proud black woman"", her race is relevant because she is proud that she has overcome the adversity and oppression she's faced by being black. Those struggles are what has made her proud, so her race is relevant.

That's why, if you were to fire back that you are a beautiful white woman (or man, I don't know) then it would feel pretty cheap. You, as a white person, haven't gone through the same race-based struggles she has. (White people *can* experience racism, but let's not even begin to pretend it's on the same level as minorities have). In this scenario, you would be using race only to create a division.

What I suspect you're running into is describing people by race at times it *isn't* relevant. If race doesn't have anything to do with the conversation, there's no reason to bring it up, and bringing it up only ""others"" people-- even if the people you're describing are of the majority, it separates them out by majority/minority. So while you might think it's fine to, for example, say ""I have four co-workers, three are white and one is black"" since you're describing *everyone* by their race, your descriptions still segregate people based on race and there's no reason to do that (unless for some reason their race is relevant).

Now, I will say that there are *some* people who will raise complaints just to raise complaints. There's absolutely people out there who will get pissy if you make any mention of race, even when it's relevant, or don't make mention of race, even when it's irrelevant.

&gt;You can cite the exact same shows as evidence to portray men as useless slobs, juxtaposed against very well put together women. Indeed many people do.

Which is just reflecting the cited evidence back and pointing out another conclusion can be argued for with it. Nowhere is it talking about how *entertaining* such positive or negative characters can be.

To your point that male characters can get away with being fat whilst female ones can't. 100% agree. And I think we both agree on the reasons why.

As to how entertaining or likeable characters are, I mean, it's very complicated and just a whole other topic. As far as women being unlikeable, I don't think the pattern is as strong as that of weight. E.g. sitcoms made of young 50/50 mixes are often all likeable and attractive. This doesn't break the pattern that men are *allowed* to be fat, but it is incongruent with the idea that women are generally unlikeable. But yes, Simpsons, family guy etc. have archetypal nagging wives. 

More generally, I don't think the minutiae of the character of men/women in sitcoms should really be informing whether men/women are argued for social movements. I think it leads to the kind of simplistic, sophomoric and overly ""activisty"" arguments I'm arguing against. So note I'm not arguing that we should advocate for unattractive men because they are fat in sitcoms - I'm arguing for some balance because fat/unattractive men and women all suffer from stigma in society. So, I think tossing men aside from the whole movement based on the argument they are ""revered"" in media based on the likes of family guy is both profoundly wrong, but also demonstrates a spectacular failure of empathy.

The rest of my comment was to point out that, to some extent, the reason why body positivity works as a movement at all, and why it uses women front and centre is because people react negatively to cruelty against women, but tolerate/don't care about cruelty to men. Incurring quite a bit of  irony this is in part due to the fact that we care about calling women ugly because we subconsciously acknowledge that beauty is a very important part of female identify, in conjunction with general protective attitudes towards women that accompany usual regressive roles of women (intrinsic value but removal of agency etc.)

I.e. The reason why body positivity has basically exclusively focused on women isn't just because women need more activism to fight for body positivity (maybe they do, but not a monopoly c.f. the rest of my argument), but that it simply *has* to use women otherwise it would just fail because people just wouldn't care about men and would respond almost in unison with points about personal responsibility and how they should better themselves if they are feeling stigma.

The result is that there is more than a big enough crack for horrible stigma against unattractive/fat men to exist whilst they get no advocacy.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

If I’m not known by name, 90% of the time, I’m referred to as “the white girl” 5 more percent I’m “the super pale blonde girl” That’s from a pretty large variety of races, probably 40% hispanic, 35% black, 10% Indian, and 15% assorted Asian and Pacific Islanders if I had to make an educated guess.

I grew up around very few white people where the norm was not-white so I tend to have a slightly different perspective from most Caucasian presenting people. What’s expected and accepted kind of varies by situation. What you can do in your hometown is different from what you’d do on a business trip. It’s really different than how you’d describe people with friends.

But a friend of mine, who’s family is Nigerian and black, described it in a way that made a lot of sense to me. First off, she’s black, not African American, just American, her parents are African American. She was born here and does not identify any other way, and doesn’t much like being labeled as “other” because of her skin color. Nobody has ever called me Irish American.

There was so much conversation around race recently (ish) because of the George Floyd incident. So many people were parroting the line “I don’t see color.” Her reasoning was if you can’t see color then you won’t see the problem. If everybody is just a blank avatar to you, you won’t notice that only some of them are being singled out and they have something you can’t even see in common.

It opens the door to intentional obliviousness and ignorance. You’re not evil, you’re just stupid. She wanted people to see her in all of her glory, as she is and that includes her race and heritage.

She believed the best way to describe a person to a sketch artist is different than to a friend. If you’re talking to a sketch artist you’re probably gonna start with - gender, ethnicity, height, build, physical features, clothing, etc etc - going from most identifying to least. Nobody would ever tell you saying a Hispanic woman is Hispanic is racist.

However, if you’re talking to a friend, why are you talking about them, what’s relevant? Do they know this person and just need to be reminded as quickly as possible? Is their race relevant to the conversation?

If you just need to know who it is as quickly and easily as possible go with what’s most recognizable in the situation. You’re a waiter and need to know who the drink is going to for example. If they’re the only white girl in the room, that’s the fastest way, go with it.

If you want to go see a movie with a friend of a friend, do you really need to know that? Is it going to help anything? Maybe the fact they’re a total marvel nerd is most relevant. Gary, huge marvel fan, big Indian guy with glasses. If you’re talking about going to see the avengers why the hell would it matter he’s Indian? You’re no longer using it as a relevant descriptor you’re just identifying some general characteristics and it probably belongs further down the list.

It just made so much sense to me that purpose and relevance are the most important part of descriptors. That we need to see color so we can identify troubling patterns of abuse. Taking away one of your most valuable senses isn’t doing anybody any favors. Just examine why you use the language you do, not because it’s racist or not, but is it useful or not.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

You could also argue that any racial descriptions are (depending on your region) inherently racist.

When describing “white” or “Caucasian” we lump a entire group of people with different languages, religions, ethnicities, culture, etc. Same with “Black” - we often use the term “African American” in the US, but what about those who are not descendants from Africa?

I could go on, and probably could’ve explained better…

It's about as new as movies and companies in general are. You just don't notice it when it aligns with your own views or the status quo, because it's unremarkable. It's even less noticeable when something controversial or countercultural at the time is no longer so.

If you're being objective, the omission and even censorship of any positive depiction of gay relationships or of gay advocacy is much more of a political statement than a brief kiss.

&gt;The idea of racial diversity in a future setting is first and foremost a stylistical choice. Especially since as you can hear by Uhuras name, it's not meant to represent the american demographics but a likely future globalized world where people from all nations and cultures go to space together.

This is a perfect example. You don't see this as controversial or political, but at the time, it was absolutely and unequivocally a controversial, political statement. It was the first interracial kiss on American television, and came just one year after the Supreme Court declared all laws against interracial marriage unconstitutional in *Loving v. Virginia*, which should inform you somewhat about what the political landscape of the time was (17 states at the time were actively enforcing their anti-miscegenation laws). To be even more clear, a Gallup poll in 1968, the same year that the episode came out, showed that a staggering 72% of all Americans disapproved of interracial marriages. The show's producers tried to make a second version for Southern audiences with the kiss off-screen, but the cast refused to do their lines right for that take; obviously, they were aware that they were making a political statement.

3. Describe them by their race “you know my friend Jill, she’s Asian”

That’s just my preference, usually I avoid using their race/ethnicity unless they have self identified by it, just because I’ve known people who don’t look like their race and while it’s not necessarily bad (since you can’t know that) it might bother them that they don’t look like their race, so I don’t wanna remind them.

Grid system made a lot of sense for horse travel too, and eventually trolleys. It’s just easier to navigate. The invention of the car spurred subdivision planning in America, meaning cul-de-sacs and curving roads. West coast cities were also planned a lot more around cars, meaning more sprawl and highway driving. East Coast cities took a lot of inspiration from European cities. Just look at L’Enfant’s Plan of DC and how it was modeled after Paris and Versailles.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

Sure, it shouldn't be illegal. That doesn't mean it should be ratified by the state in the same way that monogamous marriage is. For the record, I don't think the state should be involved in the marriage game at all. But if they're going to, we have to ask, whats the point of them doing so?

&gt;I think most marriage rights were about power and control of the population

Not sure what you mean by this specifically, so feel free to expand if you want. I think historically, marriage was used for social, political, and economic reasons. A poorer father might want his daughter to marry up, so to speak. The aspect of joining 2 families in some sort of alliance for the betterment of both was important as well, and not just for the elites. Additionally, the production and rearing of children has usually (until recently) been viewed as most proper and efficacious in the context of a marriage relationship.

And this is where the argument comes in: the state has an interest in the wellbeing of its citizens, as well as in ensuring the next generation are capable, educated, and civically responsible. We have hundreds if not thousands of years of evidence to support the idea that monogamous marriage is a good way to facilitate these goals. We have less to support the idea that polygamy will.

In short, if it ain't broke don't fix it. If you want to be a polygamist, go for it, but the state doesn't have any skin in that game (at least not demonstrably so).

The reason being is that prior, research suggested that babies can't feel pain until well after birth (which is why circumcision required no local anesthetic) which turns out to be untrue. The 2005 study (the one you're referring to) states that they cannot perceive pain, not that the pain doesn't exist. In 2020, there was a study suggesting that yes they can feel a type of pain early on but aren't sure if it's possible to be processed as pain. Between 8-12 weeks gestation they are able to produce cortisol (the stress hormone) and there are open receptors for receiving that information to become stressed. So the new argument is that they do feel but to what extent.

Obviously the part of the brain that receives it isn't developed, but the first thing formed are the nerves to tell it that it's uncomfortable. So the theory is that those are there in the meantime while it's still developing the rest (an alternative)

The only reason I find this a sound argument is because almost everything produces a hormone in this way when stressed whether it's ""aware"" in the same way we are.

Plants (which have been deemed not conscious) release hormones when stressed. Therefore it knows it's in danger of dying or that it's injured.

We worked in a restaurant and I asked FoH to get me Sam. They said which Sam. I said White Sam. We were in the back, in private, nobody but the 2 of us could hear what I said.

I got in big trouble. The actual thing they said to me was ""by saying white Sam you're inferring that the other Sam is Asian Sam"". I asked them what the point of race is if not a distinguishing physical feature, like hair colour or eye colour. They said I could have used a less offensive descriptor. In my mind saying White Sam is fine except from the inferrance that the other Sam be Asian is pandering and honestly more racist. Furthermore I asked them which descriptor to use in the future. They started with hair colour, but they shared a hair colour. They suggested weight, but they were a few pounds off of each other, not to mention I'd also get in trouble for describing someone as fat.

The reality is, people are dumb and scared. So you can't say anything at all, lest it be offensive to another dumb and scared person.

Your points are strong though - if all life is precious and I have the capacity to save one and didnt - doesnt matter who - am I now a murderer as they'd insinuate?

Again, Im pro choice. What ive been doing is trying to come up with an argument that directly addresses the right's ""concern"" with life. The best Ive been able to come up with is, by banning all abortion, youre banning all medical procedures that can save the life of the mother - that argument moves the needle and puts them into defensive mode about what doctors will or won't do (they're usually wrong). ""My body my choice"" just doesn't compute. I've heard many on the right insist it's not your choice if the baby is involved - the left is seen as saying, it's my choice if I want to take a life or not. 

Heres the way I see it - conservatives feel like there is little worse than death of a baby (dubious considering what they're ok with seeing post birth). So the argument that the mother will in any way be uncomfortable in any way just doesnt float. It has to be shown that the ramifications are *worse* than death.

It did.  No amicus challenged the precedent that squarely foreclosed an EPC argument.

No, I am not.   The difference is that one line of precedent was challenged while the other was not.  Again, SCOTUS is not in the habit of overturning precedent sua sponte when literally no litigant *or amicus* has asked it to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's try something broad, and you can tell me if you disagree: A movement is a loose association of people who have a goal of some social or political change and are actively trying to bring that goal about. 

&amp;#x200B;

If we want to talk about a movement we can talk about a consensus for what the people are trying to achieve. The problem with ""antiwork"" is that you basically have capitalists who are trying to achieve work reform, communists(and others) who are trying to replace normal work with being productive in local communities, and another set of communists who are looking for a (nearly)fully automated future with no real labor.

&amp;#x200B;

So you read through these posts and discussions and you hear competing communist theories and concepts, some of which are incompatible, and you hear them being mixed with capitalist ideas and concepts.

&amp;#x200B;

A movement doesn't need to be monolithic to be criticized, but there needs to be some consensus to call something a movement as opposed to just being a forum for discussion.  Within this forum you have two ""movements"" one trying to reform the capitalist system, and the other trying to enact some form of socialism/communism. While they may even both call themselves the same movement, it is sort of improper to conflate the two.

&amp;#x200B;

In Lightyear it's simply very obvious and direct. Especially because it's so mundane. It shows that it's lazily inserted into the movie for no reason other than being in it.

It prepares them for a world that does not exist. More directly, how exactly does concealing the existence of gay people from children help them in any way? You're not shielding them from the idea of attraction or sexuality, but rather creating the false impression that only straight people are normal, and inherently creating a bias against non-heterosexuals that is only worsened by the tendency of children to stigmatize anything and everything seen as unusual.

Let's be honest here: the only reason for someone to hide the existence of gay people from their children until a certain age is because they want to indoctrinate them into a bias towards heterosexuality and even neutral depictions of homosexual relationships undermine that goal.

&gt;Snow White kissed a man when the preferred familial status was that of a husband and a wife raising their biological children together.

So kissing on screen was only okay when society's moral values about romance aligned with your own, but now that we consider more than one arrangement to be socially acceptable we shouldn't display romantic relationships in children's media at all because they ""they should have no reason to have any interest in at such early age"" despite romantic relationships not only being omnipresent but also an important part of understanding relationships in general? I guess you made a terrible mistake by not hiding the fact that you and your wife were married from your children, by this logic. Romantic relationships have direct relevance to the lives of children at any age, even if they can't participate in them when very young, because their parents, older siblings, and other people in their lives have romantic relationships that affect them.

&gt;Today, there is zero need to address that since that whole image of a ""norm"" has gone down the drain.

Objectively false. Norms have changed, but continue to exist. The fact that your preferred set of norms are now disfavored does not mean that the concept has lost relevance or value to the modern era.

&gt;In this situation, the only reason for adding a gay kiss in Lightyear is for empty appeasement and virtue signaling.

The only reason to have exclusively straight relationships portrayed in media of any kind, including children's media, is for empty appeasement and virtue signaling if not outright homophobia. Objectively, having gay people present in media is far less egregious in these characteristics than hiding them.

&gt;This is Disney acting like activist, and this just isn't the type of relationship that parents expect from Disney.

It is objectively less activist than the alternative of concealing the existence of gay couples from children.

&gt;All the way till my son was 13 whenever a scene of two people kissing (regardless of sexes) came on TV, my wife would tell my son to look away or cover his eyes. Partially in joking mode but also seriously. The logic for this was that he would develop his own sexual interests in due time and we didn't really want him to develop the desires to go around kissing or having the need to find a girlfriend just because.

This sounds familiar enough that I can tell you, without any shred of doubt in my mind, that the only effect this could possibly have on your child is to make them feel ashamed of their own feelings of physical attraction, if it did anything at all. It's not like you could conceivably actually hide the concept of romantic love from him, given that you were married to your wife and presumably showed her affection in some way.

Look, no matter how you dress this up, an inherent and necessary part of your view is that you view straight relationships as ""normal"" and gay relationships as ""aberrant"" or controversial. Everything else is obvious pretense and post-hoc justification because it doesn't actually explain why you want Disney to only directly show straight romantic relationships.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

The other kid should be getting training to see that your kid is acting incorrectly (""silly"" and ""mean"") and that nothing your kid says is true -- we would demonstrate this by asking ""Are you a stinky poop head?"" The crying kid would laugh and then we would talk about how we want to respond: do we still want to play with your kid or have we had enough of the behavior? Your kid would most likely get another chance at friendship, but if it's been a pattern, the other kid might make a decision to cut him off.

Practicing this multiple times sets the pattern in the child's brain on how to handle this type of verbal abuse. We do it with all types of unwanted behavior as we teach boundaries. So there is attention to the feelings and a confident response to the point where repeat offenses no longer bother the kid. This requires, though, active involvement by teachers and parents, and for the home environment to be safe. A lot of kids don't get this (including myself - I had to literally learn this in parenting classes when I saw I had a deficiency because my kid's care providers were acting way different than I knew how to). As you demonstrated with your rhetorical question, it appears you did not learn this either. I'm sorry your parents were not there for you emotionally. It sucks. 

A lot of kids grow up to have emotional disconnection to themselves and intellectualization of their feelings as a defense mechanism. It is not healthy nor is it something others are obligated to walk on eggshells to accommodate.

I agree with you that people can be offensive without meaning to be. Taking offense is a choice; good manners practices the assumption of no ill intent and becoming offended just because an idea is triggered is again a personal emotional problem to be resolved in therapy. Good communication skills provides a means to resolve any questions or objections about the other person's behavior. Note this is very different from saying other people's feelings don't matter.

People are pretty dumb, but yes I agree it'd be a rare conversation. You asked for an example, not an example that is likely to happen.

&gt;And even if people speak like the strawmen you have in mind, 

This is an incorrect use of the term strawman. It's a hypothetical example, and I'm not making any argument against it.

&gt;what stops the girls from, you know, just lying?

Nothing. Besides personal integrity I guess.

&gt;And what happens if a third party finds out about the abortion and decides to press charges, who is going to be found guilty ?

Depends what kind of charges they're pressing and whether they can prove it in court. In the example above, if somehow they had an audio recording of that conversation then that would be proof the doctor knowingly lied. Or if the doctor confessed later to knowingly lying.

&gt;Maybe the doctor decided to lie in the form, maybe the girl.

Ok maybe they did. If the doctor did so knowgly and that can be proven then that would be prosecutable. What's your point?

The thong, for her, is a reminder of her sexuality and womanhood. That she isn’t just scrubs and bodily fluids.

If polygamy was legal, those girls couldn't get married until they were 18, they could unilaterally divorce, they could get a divorce settlement, and they could get custody. If they're being pressured by a community to effectively give up their right to an equal marriage, then we should go after the community.

I think the added transparency and legal certainty would do some good towards preventing forced marriage, but legalizing polygamy isn't going to solve that problem, nor is it meant to.

Maybe that other person has red curly hair and glasses.  Ok, so the person you want to identify simply by noting her skin color has no features like that?  Why are you willing to put in the work to differentiate between less dark skinned people but not dark skinned people?

The alternative is that you might contend you would be unable to distinguish anyone in the remaining 99.  So why do you need to distinguish the 1?

Then it's important to recognize that historically in America and lots of other places around the world, people were oppressed specifically *because of their skin color* in ways that leave scars on society that don't go away simply because most people stop actively doing that.  So when you're talking to someone whose heart you can't know completely, you could be feeding into their latent desire to hate or oppress.

He didn't know the name and asked for a description. I described him as short, heavier, and with thick glasses. The guy scoffed (more like *tsk*, whatever that sound is), said, ""Can't you just say what color he is? What's wrong with being black?!""

When you're poor, you need all the money you can get, and having $1000 in your emergency savings is far more valuable than the $2 in interest. Both psychologically, but also because it means you have access to that money when you might need it most. This can save you stress, but also help avoid taking on high-interest debt like credit cards and payday loans.

IIUC the only benefit you get from over-paying on taxes is that you force yourself from accessing the money on frivolous things. But aren't you going to do the same thing with it when you receive it as a lump-sum as well? The problem isn't going away, you're just deferring it while also losing access to the benefits.

You’re really hanging on that and it sounds like you’re lost on my view. I was using that as a comparison for dealing with consequences to your actions, the comparison itself not taking into account whether or not an unfeeling zygote is a human life. So you’re coming up with conclusions outside of the scope of the comparison to put in my mouth. That’s some unfair arguing and it’s looking like you’re not going to change your stance on arguing whatever you feel like so I’m probably gonna drop out after this. 

You might be right that biologists would agree that a zygote is the first stage of the human life cycle. That’s what the study op posted found and the questions it asked. It’s hard to say how accurate that study is since it seems the study was set up as advertising a hot topic in american politics and then very explicit about what that topic is once participants started. Out of 62,000, they got ~8000. Then they threw out ~3000 with roughly half self-describing as pro-choice and half describing as pro-life, which is the more interesting part of the study imo. Seems biologists are fairly town on whether or not early stage pregnancy is deserving of legal and political protection. 

To be explicit in my views so you can’t have an excuse to argue in bad faith any more, I don’t agree with late-term abortion unless there is a serious and verifiable medical reason for the mother to give it up, but even that can be iffy and becomes a very philosophical question, and I’m sure one of the hardest choices a would-be mother would ever have to make. So I’m basically attempting to get a dialogue started about where that line should be drawn. Personally, I think when that baby can experience suffering, abortion should generally be off the table. Then I agree with you because virtually the only experience that baby will have on this earth is pain and then death. But what I’m understanding you’re telling me is that the second two cells combine, that’s a person. Not just potentially a person but a full-fledged human life deserving of all of the same legal protections as any functioning human life, am I correct? So emergency contraceptives are off the table there. Would I also be correct in saying someone who is braindead should never be taken off life support, particularly if there is any chance at all that they could come back? That just being the obvious comparison since we know that person to have been a person, yet we still allow those with legal authority over their body in those situations to end their lives.

I guess what I want from you is where does “personhood” start and end. What’s more, from the mother’s perspective, how far should we all have to go as individuals to keep everyone else alive? The common argument being should you, as the closest person to someone who is in dire need of a blood transfusion, and the only match that could give blood in time to save said persons life, be forced by the state to do so? Or any other variation of that, like a system of compulsory kidney donation similar to jury duty, or every citizen of a state being an automatic organ donor, whatever. Because that says the same thing. If, say, a woman is raped and impregnated, and you consider the zygote a person with full legal rights, essentially that mother is being forced to keep it alive on life support with her own body until birth, that itself being a fairly dangerous procedure that can permanently scar. You might be pro abortion in those situations tho, idk, but even if you view it as morally reprehensible because a woman accidentally got pregnant, the same legal standard could be applied given that it is similar in legal scope to compulsory blood donations.

I didn’t paint you as religious btw. I included other common reasons someone might be anti-choice. You took that upon yourself to make an argument out of it. Strawman.

If it’s my personally held view that the world is heading downhill from here, whether or not that’s your view, or you don’t believe or follow climate science (my true biggest fear), whatever, I shouldn’t be forced to bring a child into the world I don’t think is fit to raise it, or I don’t think I’m fit to raise one in. So I don’t really understand how that can be argued with but go off.

Your grounding is a pathos argument. “Killing babies” is an emotional attack because it is decidedly not a baby in early pregnancy. That’s why we have other worlds for it, like zygote and fetus. So if you really cared about being accurate, you would say “killing a zygote,” but that’s not really emotionally grabbing. How about “ending a biological human life.” That’s accurate. Maybe wordy but I’ll leave the cleanup to you",,changemyview,7,2022,1

It’s not racist to describe someone by their physical features, features that happen to be correlated with their race/ethnicity. Equally I don’t think it’s racist to describe someone by their ethnicity, but that’s a bit more contextual. I would have no issue with someone describing me by my skin color or any other feature for that matter, as long as it’s accurate (for example a common frustration for my Asian friends is being referred to collectively as “Chinese” when they are in fact Korean, Japanese, etc.). 

This is as long as no slurs / disparaging terms are used of course. 

If I may be a bit bold and presumptuous, I think most of the criticism comes from well-meaning but slightly ignorant white folk. As you described in your example, most POCs don’t want to be told (directly or indirectly) that the person addressing them “doesn’t see color”, they just want to be respected as equals in society. 

As a closing note I think part of the issue is race is obviously a sensitive topic in some contexts, so well-intentioned people will try to be careful.

Also, you keep saying “incorporating” the 9A. As if it is not already an original part of the constitution.

Supreme Court has ruled that parents have the right to raise their children in the way they see fit in Routten v. Routten.

They determined it was a constitutional right even though the words parents or children don’t exist in the constitution.

It is now a constitutional right. Did the SCOTUS get into the constitutional drafting business? Or did they look at the concepts of liberty and derive a right from intent?

I see it as learning to be mindful, taking care of your needs, practicing self-care, protecting yourself, forgiving yourself and living intentionally. None of those require spa treatments or whatever you spend money on. I do think that can have a genuine role in self care though. 

In my experience treating myself was key in forgiving myself for my miserly ways in college and moving forward into a healthier mindset. It started out just getting a monthly lunch when I got my first job. I know it sounds silly, but when you have a mentality of “I need to save money, I don’t know what storms lie ahead and I don’t deserve something nice” it is a big step. It was about recognizing me and that I need to enjoy life now. It was about recognizing that I was debt free. I was saving a good amount for a house, emergency fund, retirement, a car, etc. It’s about recognizing that I can enjoy my money NOW not just when I’m retired. Is that not self love to be able say “I see my efforts and I’m proud of myself?” 

I think another example of this can be seen Ben Wyatt in Parks and Rec. At 18 he bankrupted his town and that was a traumatic experience for him. Since then he’s defined himself as fiscally responsible. It’s great growth, but he takes it to an extreme. I think the turning point in him as a character is when he buys the Batman suit. He feels ridiculous spending money on something so frivolous, but he does it and breaks down in a cathartic release. Yeah, he’s crying over his breakup with Leslie, but I also think it is the moment that he later will realize he’s grown so much and he can begin to leave behind ice-clown and forgive himself.  It takes him time of course, but I believe that moment-when Batman is crying- is a moment of genuine self-care. 

I don’t think going out and buying yourself services or stuff is automatically self-love, but if it’s done intentionally and in a way that affirms one’s values it can be. I think the key is to recognize the contrast, that it isn’t something that comes naturally to you, and identify your “why.”",,changemyview,7,2022,1

It is simply a boycott. And boycotts have a history of effectiveness in changing behavior. Look at how progressive major corporations have become.

&gt;  
&gt;For the sake of argument let's say it was the right decision for the organization but the people at the bottom will necessarily suffer as part of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why is it necessary? What situation is justifiable that it makes the core staff’s lives worse?

The premise was to assume that there is a situation which justifies it. Imagine any scenario you like that fits. Are you suggesting there exist zero situations where this is the case? Or are you saying you'll only discuss it if I personally come up with an example that you are satisfied with?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The decision is complex, and the average janitor or w/e doesn't have all the pieces to fully understand the decision,  
&gt;  
&gt;Why is this your assumption?

It's not my assumption always. But it's clear that sometimes this is true. Sometimes is enough. And in this particular case I know of a scenario I personally witnessed that fits this. I worked at a place where one worker fucked up (causing a pipe to bust) which pulled money from the fund that was supposed to cover new equipment for some housekeepers. Housekeepers had been told they were getting new equipment, then when they asked why they weren't getting the equipment they'd been promised they were told by some admin guy that there was no money for it. The manager who made the decision was sufficiently removed that he didn't personally explain himself to the housekeepers, and the admin guy only knows what's on the spreadsheet. So now housekeepers think the manager is broke, a liar, and generally incompetent. This stuff happens all day with that manager, and the manager justifies their decisions appropriately but the full story doesn't always reach everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;all the janitor knows is his life is getting more difficult and it's apparently Mr Executive's fault.  
&gt;  
&gt;What else can be expected? The only information given is that ‘we’ve made a decision that will make your life worse, and we’re not telling you why.’

Who says anything else is expected. I expect the janitor to gripe. I used to be in the military and we used to joke about a sailor's god given right to gripe. My point is that this incomplete information is what they're basing their judgments on and it's not realistic to keep them fully informed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There simply isn't opportunity for Mr Exec to explain it to everyone so they can understand  
&gt;  
&gt;Why not?

Let's imagine a hospital with 5000 staff. There are 5 executives with 1 lead exec. They make 10 decisions a day - we're now talking 60 decisions. Each of them have 5 managers that work under them, meaning 30 managers, each of which make - let's say fewer decisions than the execs - how about 5. So we're at 210 decisions. Each of these decisions lives within a tangled web of information changing every second. It's simply unrealistic to expect that even the sparks notes version of each of these decisions can be disseminated and understood by all 5000 staff. Even if it were, when do I, some random ground level technician, have time to absorb all this information? I have work to do! That's putting aside the complexity of deciding which parts of which decisions matter to which workers.

I'm open to ideas, because if you can solve this I'd like to learn from you and write a book from what you taught me and then I get rich.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On top of that some people don't care ""why"", they're just emotionally upset because of the hardship placed upon them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why do those who do care have to miss out on the reasoning/understanding just because some don’t?  
&gt;  
&gt;their assessment of the working situations they and others are a part of are bad assessments.  
&gt;  
&gt;They’re assessments of how it affects them, not bad assessments, and by your logic even if they were it’s not their fault, because they’ve had information withheld.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since they are bad assessments, their conclusions, recommendations for how to fix, and activism in general are not going to result in a thriving society where work is optional.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, this is an assumption.  
&gt;  
&gt;Being a janitor is nothing to be ashamed of, but it's just unlikely an average janitor will be able to wisely judge the exec's decision making.

I realize now you have completely misunderstood (and misjudged) me. I have nothing but respect for blue collar jobs. I have humble beginnings and have spent the majority of my life in blue collar jobs. It's not a janitor's lack of intellect that prevents him from understanding an executive's decisions. There simply isn't a system sophisticated enough nor enough time to get the relevant information to everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If being a janitor is nothing to be ashamed of, why are you insulting the intelligence of janitors by saying they wouldn’t understand the decision making? Why not give them the information, and if they don’t understand anyway that’s fine, but to work off the assumption that they won’t just because they’re a janitor is the exact type of elitism and arrogance that pushes people to this type of movement.

Could you please quote the part where I insulted their intelligence? I sincerely do not want to do that and wish to correct it.

&amp;#x200B;

....

Reading the rest of your post it appears you've not only misunderstood me you've somehow taken offense.

I didn't say janitors were stupid. But there are plenty that are ill-informed (often not their fault).

I didn't say everyone in the antiwork movement is lazy. But there are lazy people among them (just like every movement) and the ethos of the movement is attractive to lazy people. This is often a turn off to the hard workers out there.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

* At what point in development does the fetus become ""alive""?
* What is the definition of ""alive""?
* Do all lives have equal value, or do some have greater value than others?
* Is the value of a life dependent on it's circumstances and prospects? or intrinsic?
* What amount of inconvenience is someone morally obligated to endure for the benefit of another person?
* What amount of inconvenience should the law compel someone to endure for the benefit of another person?
* To what extent is the fetus the 'property' of the parent(s)?
* To what extent should the law protect the fetus (assuming we establish that it has some level of ""life value"")?
* To what extent should the law enforce morality (assuming we determine that abortion is immoral in at least some circumstances)?

I'm going to challenge this particular view.

If you are a member of a subreddit that emphatically espouses a view against a marginalized community, say, transphobia for example, there is a higher likelihood than not that you are not going to be welcome in subreddits for trans individuals. Is it possible that you are in the anti-trans subreddit because you are an advocate for trans rights and you're trying to win hearts and minds? Sure. But are the odds particularly strong there? Let's imagine that even a full 1% of participants in that anti-trans subreddit are actually there to fight for trans rights.

That means 99 of 100 people in that subreddit aren't. They are there to cause harm to the trans community. So why would a trans-friendly subreddit want to take a chance that you are not one of the 99 that hate them?

Further, it is entirely possible that some of the 99 people might see the humanity in the trans subreddit and have their mind changed. But is that something the residents of that community really want to risk? Any of those 99 might come in and post something horrible or vile, start fights in comment threads, just up and ruin other people's day (not to mention the potential consequences of triggering a dysphoria episode).

For my hospital for the last 48 hours.

Now a week has past and people are starting to learn about the situation. For the exec the crisis is far from over. The exec tries to give a debrief to the mid-level managers for them to disseminate the information to the front line staff. The exec also sends out a carefully worded email to all hospital staff. The exec sends out an email to all staff explaining what she can explain, which at this point is very little because the situation isn't resolved yet.

Now a month has gone by. All the managers have talked with their teams, and now the staff have started to discuss the situation among each other.

How many of the 5000 people do you think will have a fair assessment of what happened?

I would argue with this point. It's only *mildly* lazy in cases where the sub doing the banning is regularly attacked by large numbers of members of another sub violating their rules and basic premises of their community. 

And more importantly, in those cases that degree of laziness is entirely *justified*. 


Moderating is hard work and few subs have enough mods to be able to regularly deal with massive numbers of interlopers that regularly break the rules. 

Yes, there will be a few false positives, but a *massive, overwhelming* number of true positives. 

Now, if the moderators really do not accept appeals by people who once posted a *contrary* (rather than supportive or neutral) point in the other sub, perhaps I'd call *that* ""amazingly lazy"".

But that's a minority of the subs that have these policies.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

In reality, there isn't a difference between gay people and straight people in how they live their lives.  Most of my gay friends have been similar to the way they guys in Modern Family are portrayed. That is, you likely wouldn't even know they are gay unless they told you.  They are just normal people, and kids would definitely not notice any difference at all.

Personally, I am not offended by the gay kiss in Lightyear.  But many people who defend it would also defend drag queen story hour for children and other even more sexual drag show events.  

Those who are upset about the gay kiss in Lightyear, I am guessing, aren't as concerned about that scene as they are they we are on a slippery slope.  And we are definitely on a slippery slope as it relates to exposing children to sexual concepts earlier in life.  Sexuality is confusing enough for kids as it is.  It gets much more confusing when adults expose them to things that they don't need to be thinking about.  

Just let kids have their innocent childhood.  Once kids go through the confusing time of puberty, it is time to talk to them these gender and sexuality issues.  For instance, if a boy goes through puberty and realizes he is attracted to boys, we should tell him that that is a normal thing that happens to lots of boys.

I agree having sex should have no effect on whether or not you are allowed to have an abortion. And it doesn't. If abortion was fully banned (which I don't support btw) then NOBODY would allowed to get an abortion. Regardless of whether or not you have had sex.

If you are a voter in Nevada, and you are a staunch abortion rights advocate, you probably want to vote for the aboriton rights candidate, right?  I mean that only seems logical.

But abortion is not a federal issue any more.

Two candidates Red and Blue.

Red makes the campaign commercial and makes the main focus of their campaign ""Blue wants you to pay more for gas, and has voted for the policies that cause this high inflation.""

Blue make s a campaign ""Red hates abortion!  Vote for me to insure abortion rights!""

The retort from Red would be ""Abortion is a state's issue and our state already had abortion rights enshrined in law.  Blue talks about aboriton rights but for 50 year their party did nothing to pass a law at the federal level why would you think they would do it now?""

And for the vast majority of voters, with aboriton law a settled issue in their state are going to look for ways to pay less for gas, to buy groceries, and if the recession hits - to be secure in their job.  Abotion \*\*might\*\* come up in the next state house election.

This is what I mean by luxury belief.  Otherwise you have to think that there is a vast well of voter support to vote for higher energy prices just so that someone in another state a thousand miles away might benefit from a federal law that was never passed before but the party pinky swears they will pass this time.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

A lot but mostly because it promotes groupthink. Inhibiting creativity and denying yourself of personal responsibility. Ideas need to be checked and just because you like the sound of your own voice doesn't mean that that's the way things should be. There should be people there that counter your own beliefs because that's how you grow in a community. Vomiting your own shitty ideas back and forth to somebody that constantly pats you on the back doesn't do anything except create a bigger divide within a community.

I'm aware that you live in a country where overindulgence and passing the responsibility to others is a main part of your life but that's not how the world is supposed to work and I think it's at the core of why there's such a problem with mental health in the United States.

Shutting down something just because you don't like it is inherently wrong without having justification.

&gt;It prevents sexualization of any kind and allows recourse if teachers violate it.  Straight teachers cant talk about straight sex either

How many times do I have to say that it doesn't do that it stops talk about sexuality its diffrent from sex either way there's no actual guard to stopping actual grooming if a teacher wants to have sex with a student what in this law is stopping them actually nothing.


&gt;Leftists have a total misconception on this....It is as if they are lying but i think it is more that the echo chamber keeps convincing them of the falsehood.  It is hysteria.

Unnecessary under what conditions? Diminish them how? We need to develop these assertions.

Even in a perfectly behaved community, spam and technical matters need to be addressed.  I'm a mod of a relatively small sub and I would say removing spam is 90-95% of our mod queue. So a non-zero amount of value is provided even in communities where mods don't arbitrate comments.

And I've certainly seen mods who *diminish* their communities by sabotaging them or refusing to listen to community feedback, but I would say these are not a majority of my experiences.

Which two concepts? Responsibility vs Punishment?

Responsibility is the obligation one has to other(s) to take care of something that their actions caused. In the case of pregnancy from consensual sex, that obligation would be to the fetus then baby. 

Punishment is the additional consequences inflicted on someone for the sake of deterrence/prevention and even vengeance. It goes beyond just assigning basic responsibility. For example, in court, there is a difference between punitive and compensatory damages.

&gt; If it is, then it doesn’t matter how the fetus was conceived, murder is murder.

Murder requires both intent and responsibility. If responsibility isn't established, then there is no murder. For example, if someone sexually forces themselves on me, then it's not murder to kill them in self defence. There are risks to sex whether the sex is rape or consensual. If it is rape, then the woman has no responsibility for the risks. If it is consensual, then there is also consent to the risks. 

&gt; Termination is a medical decision, 

I agree that termination is a medical decision where a doctor has a responsibility to advocate for 2 patients. One of those patients (the mom) should take higher priority. But that does not mean we should totally disregard our responsibility to the fetus. 

&gt; is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term, and depending on the unique circumstances of each individual person may be the most responsible choice. 

Again, I agree. It may also be the least responsible choice. Therefore, maybe we should have medical standard of care that says: Plan B, no questions asked. Anyone who wants it, gets it. But the more a pregnancy progresses, the more medical providers should advocate (not force) alternatives to abortion.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

But you're assigning the end goal of the socialist arm of the forum (which also controls the forum itself, and therefore the stated goals of the forum) to everyone within in. I'd bet good money that -most- people on r/antiwork are not actual socialists with socialist goals, which is why describing it as a ""movement"" is weird, because I don't think most participants on the subreddit are actually there for the original purpose of the sub.

&amp;#x200B;

Labor reform as a movement has existed for a -very- long time and essentially embedded itself into the socialist sub (which is ironic because socialists often embed themselves into labor reform as well).

&amp;#x200B;

So 2 final thoughts:

A) I don't think your OP really captures the ""antiwork"" movement in an honest way, missing that most of the people posting about shitty bosses want labor reform and not socialism. Most of the people screen shotting their boss (i.e. the people you're complaining about) want better working conditions, not no work.

B) Your critique of the socialist goals falls short because your critique relies on capitalist assumptions of corporations and executives existing. Under anarcho-communism that wouldn't really be the case. Now, will anarcho-communism succeed in taking the nation by storm? Probably not, but issues like the people at the top of the hierarchy not understanding the problems of the little people or drops in production in a consumer economy aren't really problems in anarcho communism.

&amp;#x200B;

You're also making the assumption that the people with more information are acting in everyone's best interest. If the CEO gets a 50% raise but can't afford to give the janitor a raise and his best explanation is ""it's complicated"" it become -slightly- suspect that the CEO might have more information but isn't -really- making the best decisions for everyone involved.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

I realise the way I phrased my first paragraph wasn’t how I intended, I wrote:

&gt; Although I don’t believe you meant any of this with malice, it’s rubbed me the wrong way and reeks of elitism

I meant to write:

&gt; Although I don’t believe you meant any of this with malice, it’s rubbed me the wrong way and *comes off a little elitist*

Not sure why I wrote the first thing initially, brain fart moment. Hopefully me addressing this up front refranes things a little bit so my comment sounds less accusatory. Anyway, to respond:

&gt; Are you suggesting there exist zero situations where this is the case? Or are you saying you'll only discuss it if I personally come up with an example that you are satisfied with?

If you want my truthful answer - I personally believe that there are no situations where a workforce’s lives should be made worse to benefit the company, because I’m of the belief that if a company needs to sacrifice wellbeing of staff to survive that company doesn’t deserve to survive. I know that’s a pretty extreme view, and it’s not something that is applicable to all real world situations, but that’s I guess my core at what should be *aimed* for. 

To answer your question though - I didn’t say either of those things. I asked you to give me an example of a situation that is *justified* to make staff’s lives worse, where it’s okay to *not* tell those staff *why* it’s happening, which is what your premise was. 

&gt; Sometimes is enough. 

Why? Personally, I think that if a decision is being made that will impact thousands of staff, even if only *one* of those workers could understand the reasoning behind it, they should all be given it. If my life is going to be made worse because of someone else’s decision, I deserve to know why that decision was made, because it’s a lack of respect to just expect me to put up with it. It’s also better for the corp, because the morale impact will be lessened if the workers have the understanding of why they have to make the sacrifice. 

&gt; This stuff happens all day with that manager, and the manager justifies their decisions appropriately but the full story doesn't always reach everyone.

Isn’t that my argument, though? In that, in the situation you described, if everyone in that chain of communication had access to all the information everyone would have had better understanding that the issue wasn’t really anyones fault, and would have been more accepting of the fallout. That’s the way I’m saying things should be done.

&gt; My point is that this incomplete information is what they're basing their judgments on and it's not realistic to keep them fully informed.

&gt; I'm open to ideas, because if you can solve this I'd like to learn from you and write a book from what you taught me and then I get rich.

I’m gonna address your hospital example here too. Gonna use bullets otherwise this will get too long, but there’s plenty of ways to do this.

- If the company is primarily remote workers, using a public internal communication platform like Discord or Slack so that staff can see the discussions if they want
- If not remote, provide written minutes of executive meetings available to all staff 
- Regular optional update meetings where managers rely updates and changes to staff
- A weekly/monthly newsletter 
- A text alert system staff can opt in to for updates/changes 

There’s plenty more ways of doing things. Plus, your hospital example doesn’t really fit into the original framework you suggested. Sure, I’m not going to need to know every decision made every day by other members of the company, but if one of those decisions affects *me,* especially if it’s a negative effect, I deserve to be told why the decision was made.

&gt; Since they are bad assessments, their conclusions, recommendations for how to fix, and activism in general are not going to result in a thriving society where work is optional.

&gt; I realize now you have completely misunderstood (and misjudged) me. I have nothing but respect for blue collar jobs. I have humble beginnings and have spent the majority of my life in blue collar jobs.

That’s not entirely on me, this CMV specifically uses laziness and ignorance as the reason you think this movement will fail in its title, which is the exact argument thrown at the movement to discredit it. You also made repeated mention to the laziness of workers, without commenting on *why* these workers are ‘lazy’ which again is the same argument made to try and trash the movement. Your post doesn’t cover the fact that people aren’t downing tools because of the shitty work conditions, you frame people doing this as it just being a selfish decision by ‘lazy morons’ that affects the other members of staff that ‘work hard’. This puts the onus of responsibility on the workers to work hard despite not getting rewarded for it, instead of putting the onus of responsibility on the bosses to compensate their workers fairly. I’m not attacking you here, btw - I’m just explaining how your post sounds. There’s no defence of the worker in your post outside of one sentence in your first paragraph. It reads as though your thoughts are that the action of not working hard is in and of itself a moral failing, regardless of the level of compensation, which is completely antithetical to what I believe. I’ll work hard when I get paid what I should get paid to work hard, refusing to do so doesn’t make someone lazy, and it’s not their fault other members in the team need to pick up the slack. In fact, the other members *shouldn’t* IMHO, because the only way these companies will realise things are burning is if these hard workers stop putting out the fires. 


&gt; It's not a janitor's lack of intellect that prevents him from understanding an executive's decisions. There simply isn't a system sophisticated enough nor enough time to get the relevant information to everyone.

There is, see above. And if there’s not, that’s not and excuse - we should build one.

&gt; Could you please quote the part where I insulted their intelligence? I sincerely do not want to do that and wish to correct it.

Mainly this (emphasis mine) as a cap to the stuff I mentioned above: 

&gt; it’s unlikely an average janitor will be able to **wisely judge** the exec’s decision making

You can see how this reads as the average janitor not being wise enough to understand and exec’s decision, right? Again, not attacking you, just pointing this out. If you instead said ‘the average janitor will likely have had crucial information withheld that would allow them to reach and informed conclusion’ it would have read very differently.

(Side note: the ‘arrogance and elitism’ I mentioned wasn’t meant to be directed at you, I meant that it sounds like the arrogance and elitism that is aimed at low level workers by their employer that leads to workers not being told these decisions. That’s my bad for wording it poorly.) 

&gt; Reading the rest of your post it appears you've not only misunderstood me you've somehow taken offense.

I’m not offended, genuinely. If I sounded sharp that’s going to be a combination of this being the internet and tone being hard to convey and your argument sounding eerily close to the ones I hear all the time to discredit antiwork and similar movements. I’m one of those ‘lazy morons’ who you referred to, but I’m not lazy because I just can’t be bothered to work and I’m happy for others to pick up the slack, I’m ‘lazy’ because if I’m not going to given the respect of me compensated fairly for my time I’m not going to respect my employer enough to give my all in return, and I encourage others to do the same.

&gt; I didn't say janitors were stupid. But there are plenty that are ill-informed (often not their fault).

See above.

&gt; I didn't say everyone in the antiwork movement is lazy. But there are lazy people among them (just like every movement) and the ethos of the movement is attractive to lazy people. This is often a turn off to the hard workers out there.

Again, see above - this reads like you believe ‘laziness’ is in and of itself a moral failing and the hard workers are the ‘good ones’ - I could make the opposite argument, in that the ‘hard workers’ are making other people’s lives more difficult by setting unrealistic standards for workers to hit. If you have two workers, one doing 50% of their work and the other doing 150%, the execs are going to expect everyone to be able to work at 150% to match their ‘best’, without offering higher compensation because if one person can do it why can’t everyone? I’m not trying to shit on hard workers, I’m just saying it’s *neither* group’s fault. This wouldn’t happen is staff were compensated fairly (which you’ll see in companies where staff *are* compensated fairly, in that productivity happiness and work life balances are generally better).

I hope this explains my points better - at the core of it, my issue with your argument is that it doesn’t seem to account for the fact that these problems are *caused* by the employer not the employee, and the actions taken by workers that you believe will stop this movement are direct results of the employers actions.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

[To copy another comment I made about a philosopher's stance:](https://hsci.harvard.edu/examining-ethics-embryonic-stem-cell-research)

&gt; MS: Consider an analogy: although every oak tree was once an acorn, it does not follow that acorns are oak trees, or that I should treat the loss of an acorn eaten by a squirrel in my front yard as the same kind of loss as the death of an oak tree felled by a storm. Despite their developmental continuity, acorns and oak trees differ. So do human embryos and human beings, and in the same way. Just as acorns are potential oaks, human embryos are potential human beings.

Clearly, it isn't cut-and-dry, even if Sandel's analogy has flaws. Beyond a random philosopher's opinions, society makes it clear that killing a zygote/embryo is not morally equivalent to ending a baby's life. IVF clinics destroy embryos all the time, and we don't consider it a crime equivalent to the Holocaust. A miscarriage, especially early on, isn't the same as an adult dying. Embryonic stem cell research isn't the same as human experimentation. The ""will develop"" argument doesn't feel that bulletproof to me. 

Like (to be facetious), does fapping count as mass murder? You could say that it's a matter of probability: that the object at hand needs to have a good chance of developing into a child. But then would fapping be equivalent to abortion and ending a life if you could have impregnated someone with your sperm with good probability (or if a scientist could have taken your sperm to artificially inseminate an egg)? 

Maybe you could argue that the ""miracle of life"" hasn't happened yet, but that's a rather arbitrary boundary that's completely separate from the ""will develop"" argument. For example, what about the cases when the miracle of life happens but the object is very unlikely to develop into a human (like IVF)? What about if an object is likely to develop into a human but has not yet achieved ""the miracle of life"" (like an egg and sperm just preceding fertilization)?

Again, all the concerns you raise are valid, and I'm not pretending all small town cops are folksy Andy Griffith types. There's a bunch of corrupt, violent, bigoted meatheads too.

More specifically, while USA overall is a lot wealthier than it used to be a generation or two ago, neither salaries and wages nor welfare and other forms of social support have kept up. 

As an example, take minimum wage.  In inflation-adjusted terms it was about $11 in 1970. Since 1970 the inflation-adjusted GDP/capita of USA has approximately tripled, so for someone working minimum wage to be equally well off (relative to the country overall) today as they were in 1970, minimum wage would have to be approximately $30. In reality it's $7.25 which is markedly LESS than it was 50 years ago, despite (as I said) the country overall having roughly 3 times the GDP/capita.

Especially the right always postulates **growth** in the economy as the solution. But I think it's a good question why the working poor should believe that to be of benefit to them when over a period of over 50 years, the economy overall has about tripled (per capita!) and yet, the result for people working at minimum wage has been a DECREASE in income.

These are pre-tax amounts, so taxes play no role here.

There's no benefit to growth for the poor if in parallell with the growth the distribution of income gets more and inequal so that they merely get a smaller and smaller fraction of a larger and larger cake, and end up with less than what they started with, even if the cake overall is tripled.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

This is why Republicans aren't invited or will be kicked out if you show up to the DNC and start arguing with people, and vis-versa.

Can you show the math on this?

Someone making 2k per month 24k per year is highly unlike to be paying property tax on anything other than a car.

So lets say they have a car worth 10k thats $72 per year or $6 per month

Medicare easy: 1.45% or $29 per month

Social Security is 6.2% or $124 per month

Income tax (federal and state) on 24k for a single person in my state is $3,707 per year or $308.91 per month.

Lets add up $6 + $29 + $124 + $309 = $468 per month which is 23%.

To get to this ""easily loses half their income"" on a sales tax rate of 7.25% they have to be accruing $532 in sales tax. 

Math says to rack up $532 in sales tax one needs to spend $7337.93 per month in my county/state.

1) Low minimum wage. If you're getting paid $7.25-15 an hour it's hard as hell to get out of poverty. Getting rid of some of those taxes might help out the situation moving it to $7.25-13 an hour. But it's still insanely rare to get out of poverty with that kind of wage. 

2) High rent costs. Property taxes aren't a poor tax. Poor people tend not to own property. They do on the other hand tend to rent. Which is expensive as fuck and doesn't have much to do with the previously mentioned taxes. Rather the housing market which needs a serious crackdown via federal or state intervention.

The point I was illustrating is that it comes down to subjective morality. You could argue there is some divine objective reality given by “insert random God here” that says human life is more important or even valuable.


But there is absolutely no evidence of this. The only reason you think you’re valuable, is because you are you. The only reason you deem human life the most valuable, is because you are a human. That’s subjective reality and there’s many great thinkers who argue the opposite. One look at our planet which is becoming increasingly dystopian shows that we are objectively terrible for the ecosystems which we require to live. This is very similar to cancer. 


And an example on how my subjective morality is different than yours is that I would save my dogs life over some strangers embryo. I’d save my dogs life over someone’s baby or kid. Why? Because, subjectively, my dogs life means more to me than some strangers that I don’t know. That’s how the world operates on every fundamental level. If it didn’t, we wouldn’t be in a capitalist nation with ever increasing inequality, increasing infant mortality and shorter life expectancy. We wouldn’t be ignoring our actions that lead to catastrophic climate change that many nations are already feeling the effects of. We all live in our own little subjective bubbles.


Why I say all of this in an abortion argument? It’s because pro-life’s entire argument is based on them trying to take away women’s freedom and choice of bodily autonomy based on their subjective morality that the embryo is more important than them. This is shown in the states trying to make abortion completely illegal which puts women at risk of death and to be punished for life after being raped. There’s no choice, that is using the government to make citizens comply with a small populations personal philosophy on what lives are important.

So it doesn't really matter that marriage is limited to the (fairly modern) concept of monogamy, so long as people are allowed to form households with whomever they wish.

If we look at what secular marriage used to offer, it was security (your partner won't run off with someone else, or if they do, they leave everything behind); child support and consistent care (and it is now understood, in ways it never was before, how vital this is for a healthy next generation); property/inheritance rights so a couple could work differently for the family and share in the other's efforts. This can all be done in a multiple marriage where everyone marries anyone new (that is important) but can more easily be done through private, binding agreement.

I use the term 'multiple marriage' to differentiate from the situation where one person is free to marry many, regardless of the views of existing spouses. While patriarchal polygyny works in a society structured for it - and matriarchal polyandry could too probably but I know of no such contemporary example - a society structured around individualism (Western nations) or monogamy (much of the rest of the world) would struggle converting to such marital forms.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

You’re suggesting they acted before any crime was committed, I’m not sure how that’s possible unless China has psychics.

Just checked wikipedia and apparently I was wrong about the before they militarized part, because apparently they were armed and in violent conflict with the Chinese government since the 1990s so that throws the **might** have out the window, since apparently they did raise arms except they lost to the Chinese government.

They cite the Constitution quite a bit. And I think it’s good that they rely heavily on precedent. Like I said before, I think judges should strive to create a coherent and predictable legal system. Respecting precedent means laws are more stable and people know what to expect. Judges like Thomas don’t care about precedent and are happy to overturn precedent to impose their own views of the Constitution on everyone. 

So I’m not saying the Court can *never* overturn precedent. But I definitely think it’s a good thing, not a bad thing, that the dissent extensively cites all the precedent on its side. 

And it’s not like the majority grapples extensively with the language of the 14th Amendment. There’s not much language there. They just play amateur historians instead. 

*Bostock*

The whole point of textualism is judges *don’t* try to read legislators’ minds. It doesn’t matter what Congress in 1964 meant to say. What matters is what they actually said. And they banned discrimination “because of sex.” If an employer fires a man, and it wouldn’t have fired a woman who did the exact same thing, then that’s discrimination “because of sex.” 

Alito and the other dissenters in that case were the ones trying to read the minds of legislators. Congress hated gay people back then, so surely they didn’t mean *that*. Well, the words of the statute are what they are. If a person’s sex is the difference between getting fired or not fired, that’s sex discrimination, regardless of whether Congress really thought through all the consequences of its words. Courts shouldn’t invent exceptions to laws. 

Severability

I think it would have been arrogant for the Court to invent a new interpretation of the Commerce Clause to find a provision of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. It would have been even more arrogant to strike down the entire law, including unrelated provisions like the Medicaid expansion. The Court shouldn’t re-write a statute — but it can block the enforcement of one provision. 

It would have been a partisan decision, giving Republicans what they couldn’t achieve through the democratic process. 

Democracy

The Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. Health care and the environment are classic examples of issues that are intertwined with interstate commerce. If one state pumps carbon or other pollutants into the atmosphere, that affects other states too. 

And climate change, in particular, requires a national (and international) response. I get that you’re happy with the status quo. But that has consequences — and potentially catastrophic ones. 

And again, the problem here is that Republicans have a major advantage in the Senate — and substantial advantages in the House and Electoral College too. There’s a thumb on the scale in their favor. 

So even in a good election for Democrats, Republicans can probably block just about anything. But a good election for Republicans means they’ll get to steamroll the opposition. They’re not going to be content with respecting the rights of blue states. They’ll slash taxes for the rich, roll back environmental protections, stack the courts, and maybe even ban abortion nationwide. And, of course, alter election rules to cement their power. 

I’m sure this rigged system is great if you like conservative policies. But it’s not really democracy. It doesn’t represent the American people. 

And I don’t really know how you can see this Court’s agenda of dismantling the regulatory state,  overturning state gun laws, allowing illegal voter disenfranchisement, and ending abortion rights as anything other than one part of the conservative political strategy. Many conservatives voted for Trump so he could pick these justices. The justices were vetted by the Federalist Society. This is part of a deliberate agenda to impose conservative policies on the country.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

i disagree. While i do disagree that term limits ultimately will do nothing, i do disagree that corruption is inevitable, and believe that a system could be successfully crafted to deter it: 

1. the people - not the federal government, need to establish a fourth branch of government, specifically accountable to the people, and distinctly separated from the federal government, that expressly is focused on curtailing the government corruption at federal and state level. 
2. this branch needs the ability specifically to try, and penalize ANY federal government officials, up to and including the president, for any legitimized violation of the law codified under the us constitution - and they must be capable of trying only federal government officials,  in a secondary court of law, similar to how the military is premised to run its own court.
3. this new enforcement body answers directly to state governors.
4. its members are selected by lottery selection of qualified applicants. a qualified applicant would have a background in law enforcement, legal study, civil service, etc. 
4. All members of this body are kept as anonymous actors, whos identities cannot be made known.
4. All charges bought by this body, are bought by the states themselves, on behalf of this body - as in the state is the direct accuser.
3. the penalties that need to come as part of convictions of corruption - need to be so insanely deep, and prohibitive, that no degree of money would be worth the risk. I.E. any thing from complete and total asset forfeiture, Life in prison, revocation of citizenship, potentially even death. 
4. i argue that corruption at its core is treason.. If the people are truly the sovereigns of the sate, and those actions are done to betray the faith and good will of the people, in ways designed to harm them - then all of the punishments associated with treason become logical punishment.   

for example - both Donald Trump, and Barrack Obama authorized the extrajudicial killing of American citizens - ***specifically the killing of children*** without charge or trial, and then handwaved it as 'collateral damage'. 

Name one cop who could lob a hand genade, or more realistically even their firearm, at a mugger and not be bought up on trial for killing twenty nearby pedestrians as well in the process. no sane individual would even be ok with one American citizen being killed in the process. not only did they do this - they EXPLICITLY attempted to conceal, and hide the evidence that they had done so. 

This body would have the power to ensure that both of those individuals, and everyone who participated in the act, were bought to justice for their explicit criminal act.   

we absolutely need a fourth arm of government that does not answer to the judiciary, or the executive, to pursue these crimes.

You can program the computer to do with that datastructure whatever you want. I can program it to ignore every other block for example.

So, if we program our votecounter to only count the last vote, then we can cancel someone's vote by entering a new entry into the blockchain.
However, we can not do this with the system that /u/ansuz07 proposes, not as a limitation of the programming technique in the blockchain, but as a limitation on the concept of electronic voting as a whole.

/u/ansuz07 relies on some unknown, offline, non-blockchain system to anonymously provide every citizen with a secret key. (This is in and off itself a challenge, but let us assume that it works).
Now every single person in the country has exactly 1 secret key, and we do not know which secret key that is.

Thus, while we can program our vote counter to ignore any vote we want to ignore, we do not know which votes those are. We have no way to associate Bob the person with Bob's secret key, so  we can't know what vote to invalidate. 

The same problem manifests itself in paper voting. Once the vote goes into the ballot box, you can not get it out. You don't know which ballot is who's.
This is why the votes of maybe ineligible people are written on separate provisional ballots. They do this by just putting the vote in an envelope, and writing the voter's information on said envelope. If the vote is accepted, the envelope is opened and the vote (without looking) is put inside the ballot box. You are counting on the voting system to destroy the information that links your provisional form to your vote (instead of them opening the envelope and reading your vote, at which point they do know who you are voting for).

For instance, I don't think there is anything wrong with a cop not policing infractions of the law when no harm to the community is present. The law is not sacred; it exists to further and protect the shared interests of the polity, therefore, when those shared interests are not affected, there is no reason the law should be respected or enforced.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's basically a gang at this point with zero accountability.

This is just not true. I know that it is part of the current zeitgeist to think that every cop is just a thug with a badge, but that just isn't the reality. County sheriffs are typically elected, meaning that they are directly accountable to the community they serve, and by extension their departments. Elsewhere, chiefs of police might be appointed by the mayor, to whom they are accountable, and thus so are their departments. If a local department were to become corrupt, you can report them to a higher authority for investigation.

Moreover, none of the issues you raised are fundamentally solved by abolishing local departments and expanding state agencies, it just expands the potential for abuse by state agencies. Corrupt state troopers might harass a governor's political opponents, or they might work with a corrupt judge towards whatever nefarious end.

Pennsylvania goes red if you drop Philadelphia and maybe Pittsburgh. New York goes either red or purple if you drop NYC. Nevada definitely goes red if you drop Las Vegas. Illinois goes red if you drop Chicago.

So it works both ways. It's kind of a tug-of-war. But this problem seems fundamental to the system of Democracy, where you only need 51% to ensure your side wins. So it's like a tug-of-war where if each side just gets one additional person, they win. So with democracy, any arbitrary geopolitical division is going to disenfranchise someone. Like blue cities are not completely blue, and tend to get more red as you get out into the suburbs.

But in principle, I don't see any reason why large municipalities should not have greater self-governance. To make that fair though, the big cities should give up their influence on state elections in return. So for instance, a large city like NYC would almost act as its own state. They would be free of decrees from Albany, but they also would lose the right to boss around Upstate NY (where they seldom ever go anyway).

To make this work, you would still need to figure out the implementation details of how to coordinate infrastructure. That's the tricky part, but I suppose Washington D.C. has figured it out since it needs to coordinate its infrastructure with Virginia and Maryland.

Voting electronically, in general, is a terrible, terrible idea. Just off the top of my head here are a few issues.

First, your secret key eliminates the anonymity of the voting booth, which is a massive flaw. Currently, if I bribed you to vote it is pointless. I give you $50 bucks, you walk into a voting booth and I have to assume that you voted the way I told you to vote, but I can't prove it. This is the reason we don't let people take photos of their ballots, for example, and why we will spoil ballots that have markings on them that are not supposed to be there.

Your secret key system makes it trivially easy for you to show someone else how you voted. In addition, if your secret key is ever leaked which is again, not particularly hard, then anyone in the world with access to the leak can see how you voted.

Next, it carries with it the usual fuck off risks of general electronic voting. Blockchains are reasonably strong against man in the middle attacks, but they are just as weak against the more common forms of hacking. Someone makes a worm that steals your key when you put it in? Congrats, they stole your vote. Someone keylogs your shit, congrats they now have your secret key and can broadcast it around. Crypto is only as secure as the end user, and if bitcoin et al have taught us anything it is that the end user is dumber than a sack of bricks.

Lastly a blockchain would add all of the usual issues with electronic voting, but also the added benefit of being subject to some form of 51% attack which... yikes.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

Around that same rate, 1 in ten veterans are living in poverty. So still not a guarantee.

The biggest complaint I have heard regarding the military is how it destroys your body. Almost all of the people I know have some chronic injury sustained during deployment or time in the military. This is something that has prevented some of them from being able to fully work and dealing with prescription pain medication. They have also told me stories of some fellow soldiers being partially or fully disabled, due to an incident. Any chronic injury also requires you to work with the VA, which is notoriously bad and providing support. It is a bit wild to essentially risk your physical health to such a degree just to “get out of poverty” only to be faced with it again.

Also, PTSD is a real issue in the military, both in active deployments to hostile areas, and at home with terrible XO’s, emotional abuse and sexual assault. The statistics for trauma in the military are quite high, and it is likely underreported. Many former soldiers I know have pretty mean substance use issues they use to mask their trauma, which is another can of worms. Also, I should mention the danger that is present for women.

Can you give me an example that wasn't a second hand citation? I acknowledge I briefly skimmed through the dissent a second time and may have missed it. But again, all the references to the constitution I found were 2nd hand as viewed through Roe and/or Casey, or a paraphrase (in light of their views).

&gt;Judges like Thomas don’t care about precedent and are happy to overturn precedent to impose their own views of the Constitution on everyone.

Thats probably not a fair interpretation. Thomas remains loyal to the document. He is absolutely correct that ""Substantive Due Process"" is nonsense. But I can see the argument that it's a bridge too far at this point. Perhaps in the future.

&gt;And it’s not like the majority grapples extensively with the language of the 14th Amendment. There’s not much language there. They just play amateur historians instead. 

The cite the Constitution itself frequently. They cite the 14th. Amateur historian is still a deeper (and more honest) view than the dissent took. The Dissent blatantly misrepresented and openly lied about history. The majority addressing it is an improvement to that.

&gt;If a person’s sex is the difference between getting fired or not fired, that’s sex discrimination, regardless of whether Congress really thought through all the consequences of its words. Courts shouldn’t invent exceptions to laws. 

I agree with you there. I don't think it's in play for Gorsuch's opinion. They aren't discriminating against the person for being a man or a woman, they're discriminating based on their perceived actions. Discrimination based on actions is perfectly acceptable. Reinterpreting it to be sex based is the problem. 

You didn't address that words meaning changes.

You'd agree that a law stating ""You have a right to be gay"" (from 1800) does not mean ""You have a right to be homosexual"" (in 2022) or are you interpreting that Congress should be fortune tellers and predict changes in the language? (Especially terms being co-opted like 'Gay'.)

&gt;I think it would have been arrogant for the Court to invent a new interpretation of the Commerce Clause to find a provision of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional.

There was not new interpretation. The simple version - Congress can apply taxes. Congress cannot apply fines. The legislation called it a fine. Roberts offered them ""You MEAN a TAX?"" And they ran with it. That was inappropriate. 

&gt;It would have been even more arrogant to strike down the entire law, including unrelated provisions like the Medicaid expansion. The Court shouldn’t re-write a statute — but it can block the enforcement of one provision. 

Hard disagree. To me it is more arrogant to decide what parts to keep and what parts to strike than to dismiss the entirety and say ""I don't know what is critical, write it again"". Frankensteining legislation is much more arrogant than returning it to the people whose job it is to write legislation. The Court should not be Legislating (or changing legislation) from the bench. Again, they ruled the Line Item Veto unconstitutional, then practice it themselves.

&gt;Health care and the environment are classic examples of issues that are intertwined with interstate commerce. If one state pumps carbon or other pollutants into the atmosphere, that affects other states too. 

Agreed. Climate is an interstate commerce event.

Healthcare rather specifically is not. This has been held by some of the problems in Obamacare. Health insurance cannot cross state lines. (One of Trump's proposed solutions to healthcare costs was to allow it to cross state lines). There is no conceivable method I am aware of to argue that healthcare is an interstate commerce issue without an extremely tortured interpretation. I noted you didn't even try to explain it. Just went to climate.

&gt;They’re not going to be content with respecting the rights of blue states. They’ll slash taxes for the rich, roll back environmental protections, stack the courts, and maybe even ban abortion nationwide. And, of course, alter election rules to cement their power. 

You're fear casting.

Slash taxes for the rich? Probably.

roll back environmental protections - depends on which ones. But yes, and they should.

stack the courts - has never been a Republican talking point. Only been threatened by a Democrat in history and present. Republicans have played strictly within the rules. (Whether their actions were shady is another question, they absolutely were. But they were against utilizing precedent set by Democrats).

And, of course, alter election rules to cement their power. - Much like Democrats do.

&gt;And I don’t really know how you can see this Court’s agenda of dismantling the regulatory state, overturning state gun laws, allowing illegal voter disenfranchisement, and ending abortion rights as anything other than one part of the conservative political strategy.

Because I don't agree with those terms (generally). I disagree with your framing.

&gt;dismantling the regulatory state

Or returning federal agencies to within their congressionally delegated powers. Executive over reach is a significant problem. Federal overreach is a significant problem. 

&gt;overturning state gun laws

Only insofar as states cannot prohibit (or effectively prohibit) the 2nd Amendment. They have not said you cannot restrict guns within New York. They have said you cannot pretextually prohibit the entire ability to carry guns in New York. The entire ruling basically comes down to the 6+1 ""may issue"" states must become ""shall issue"" states. ""Stop restricting CCL on a pretextual basis.""

And I disagree with that decision. 

&gt;allowing illegal voter disenfranchisement

Did not do that. That is just a blatantly false framing.

&gt;ending abortion rights

Ending FEDERAL abortion rights. States can have as many abortion rights as they want. This is again an issue where the federal government has no business. The entirety of the Supreme Court's decision was that the Supreme Court never had any business getting involved. Getting involved in 1973 was a mistake, getting involved now is a mistake. It is a question for the people and the states.

I reject this being just a ""Conservative political strategy"" because the Supreme Court has the power to federally ban abortions. If their logic is irrelevant and outcomes are all that matter (like the progressive courts of the past), why did they not outright ban abortion? Why did they simply remove the federal government from the equation?

I absolutely agree that there will not be a federal codified Roe. That is a good thing. I also believe the Supreme Court has signaled they will not allow a federal ban or promotion of abortion without a direct constitutional amendment. It is not a federal issue until that point.

It's honestly somewhat hilarious to me that everyone is saying returning the decision to elected officials, that must face the people, at the lowest possible level is somehow LESS democratic than 9 Justices in robes deciding the issue for the country.

I don't get professional manicures, but I do enjoy painting my nails and I consider it an act of self love. During the first wave of COVID I was at the most stressed I have ever been and my mental health took a nose dive (I work in healthcare). Eventually I stopped taking care of myself, stopped looking after myself and stopped loving myself. The first day last year when I picked up nail polish and decided to put it on was the sign things had changed. 

Painting my nails was and still is an act of self love because it shows I love myself enough that I want to have nails that make me smile when I see them. It is an act of self love because I want beautiful things to shine and painting my nails reminds me that I am beautiful and I deserve to look my best. 

Self-love is an incredibly personal thing and there aren't many things that unanimously *are* or *are not* self-love. It depends on the individual. Personally I think in our culture that almost anything that requires spending money (and doesn't harm you) can be a form of self-love. We are told every single day by our society that money is one of the most precious commodities we have. If I can choose to spend some of that money purely on something that makes me feel good, makes me smile and that highlights to others that I love myself and care about how I want to present myself to the world, then isn't that self-love in and of itself?

I've seen them myself. They literally pinned the Unite the Right event to their frontpage. The comments are full of indirect and direct threats and calls to violence. to ""fight"" literally for their white race.

It was an event they came armed to, ready to fight, wearing helmets and carrying shields and weapons while the counter protestors had none of these things, they chanted all sorts of racist and bigoted things like ""The Jews will not replace us"" and then sure enough got the violence they came prepared for.

They drove a *car* into a crowd of people.

Any pretense that the subreddit was not filled with hate and calls to violence is a denial of reality. It was so bad that it has been the center of [actual studies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06455v1.pdf).

TD broke just about every community standard Reddit has. 

&gt;I frequently see real calls to violence in politics and other leftist subs by users. Does that reflect the mindset of those communities?

Are those individual users that get reported and then banned? Because a user making a comment means nothing. Have you seen what was pinned on TD? Blatant racism and calls to violence against any race other than whites, particular hate and calls against muslims and ""unamericans"".

If your best comparison to what TD had its mods sticky on its frontpage are individual users making comments that should be reported and banned, I don't think you have a solid grasp of equivalency.

&gt;Statistically speaking, the larger the community, the more inevitable it is that you will come across people saying a wide range of things, from all across the political spectrum, good or bad. That’s literally how society works.

Again, TD was actioned not because it didn't perfectly police every user in the comments section. It would sticky rule-breaking content to its front page. It wasn't that some members broke the rules, its that the subreddit itself was openly breaking the rules.

&gt;Unless such calls to violence are endorsed and aided by the general community/mods themselves, then the individual instances of people calling for violence does not reflect the general community.

I've seen plenty of examples personally where people who otherwise had the skillset to perform well and succeed failed to adapt to military life properly, and usually it was due to something with their personality or their inability to accept the rules imposed on them as part of being in the military. In addition as I'm sure has been mentioned by now, some (few) jobs in the military are far more difficult than others and far more dangerous, with vastly higher chances of acquiring some form of problem such as PTSD or injury. For people who have the personality issues I discussed in particular, joining the military may actually lead to more suffering than staying out of it due to increased restrictions placed on your behavior by military life.

* because if my movie idea based on the second Oz book The Marvelous Land Of Oz does well I'd want a sequel series based on the other Oz books (but centering around Dorothy (as in book continuity she comes back to stay with uncle and aunt in tow eventually), Ozma (the princess protag of book 2 who's eventual best-friends with Dorothy in a way that you could tell would become something more if the books were written today) etc. to avoid sprawl) people would get mad that I left the relationship until the sequel series even though Dorothy doesn't come back until book 4 and it'd be kind of a slow-burn

Their game, their rules. In order to run your server, you have to comply with their TOS, and that now includes the rules about what you can and can't do on their game. 

&gt; we're talking about how people want to play the game they've purchased.

From their rules: 

&gt; Although we license you permission to install on your device and play our Game, **we are still the owners of it**. We are also the owners of our brands and any content contained in the Game. Therefore, when you pay for our Game, you are buying a license to play / use our Game in accordance with this EULA - **you are not buying the Game itself**. The only permissions you have in connection with the Game and your installation of it are the permissions set out in this EULA.

Still their sandbox. They're just inviting you in to play in your own little corner of it but they retain final say over it. This isn't a weird concept. This is how you use twitter, even if you have a widget on your own website, or you use google assisted search even though it's on your own site. Just because you have it and get to tinker with it doesn't mean it's ultimately yours. 

You don't own the game. You don't get to set the rules in a place that isn't yours. They're a landlord, you're a tenant. You have some rights but they hold the final say. 

If you don't enjoy that business model, you're welcome to invent your own game and let people download it and keep it forever. Microsoft and Mojang don't agree and this is how thye want to run their business. 

Also, keep in mind, *again*, they aren't imposing impossible rules. They aren't forcing you to do horrible, henious things that make you pay lots of money or that heavily restrict how you use the game. 

 They've made it clear that mods will have discretion in their own servers to do what they want within those guidelines and they are *very* low bars to get over to keep the admins away from your server. Like, don't spam the n word, don't let spammers come in and spam their onlyfans all over the place, and don't threaten to doxx someone you don't like and you're at least 75% the way to being golden.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

And you eventually give up your alternative crystal treatment beliefs and then begin fighting back HARD against those alternative treatments. That is brainwashing: the process of pressuring someone into adopting radically different beliefs by using systematic and often forcible means. It doesnt have to be forceful. But an academic curriculum is systematic. And the education pressured you into adopting radical different beliefs in order for you to pass. 

Basically brainwashing can be applied to a TON of things as a term. It is all just a matter of degrees. And it is not inherently something heinous or evil.

&gt;A few bad apples doesn’t ruin the bunch, and silencing participation in any case, unless it’s a confirmed brigade of bad actors is the wrong thing to do.

Mods are unpaid actors, volunteering their time for a community. Maybe they think the time spent stomping out users who are active on other subreddits is getting too cumbersome.

Does r/neoliberal spend a significant amount of time moderating commenters from r/conservative? They may find it takes too much time and make such a ban to ease workload. Sure you get caught up, but just make a new account like many other people do to interact with different communities.

&gt;Every case of silencing an account should be evaluated on the merit of why, and “whack a mole” is certainly not the answer.

That's what ""Whack -a-mole"" is. Evaluating each instance for banning. It's whack a mole because it largely doesn't solve the problem, you only deal with the symptoms.

Fundamentally disagreeing with something and doing it anyway is what psychologists call cognitive dissonance. So the question that now faces you, is whether you are morally bankrupt or brainwashed into cognitive dissonance? Do you follow orders that violate your sense of morality because it’s good money or because you’ve been psychologically conditioned to ignore your conscience? Or perhaps there is some third reason I haven’t thought of that you can explain the reasoning behind. Otherwise I think that both scenarios are equally horrendous and equate to an incredibly convincing reason not to join the armed services. 

Obviously there’s a lot of non combat jobs too that do a lot of good in the world that don’t involve morally questionable orders.

The reason for this is that people need to be able to work cohesively, but it doesn't really change your views outside of the expected from engaging in a profession (people who go to college might tend to have more liberal views, people who are lawyers probably have changed views on the judicial system, etc). Most people in the army tend to insult it or complain about it, rather than compliment it. Usually over leadership, unnecessary tasks, or the pointlessness of a war (Afghanistan was the main one I heard mentioned for that one). 

In terms of shooting the enemy, my experience was not that they tried to dehumanizing the enemy, but that they tried to toughen up the soldier. This is because if they are genuinely engaged in combat, a mental breakdown will put their life in danger. Maybe dehumanizing the enemy is more common for infantry or in the past, but they didn't really make any effort to do so in my BCT.

It's also taught that you should not obey unlawful orders. One example of an unlawful order would be shooting civilians, or prisoners of war.

It doesn’t seem that far-fetched to me, I mean a lot of people feel humiliated when they change their mind after spending so much time and effort in something they believed. 
I’m not sure if these studies explore that possibility, to me it doesn’t seem like they do, and so they could be underestimating the percentage of de-transitioners. 
Before you accuse me of something: I’m sure gender affirming care is important and necessary, and I would never want it to be outlawed or even restricted, I’m sure it dies more good than harm. 
De-transitioners are surely a minority…… just, maybe not that negligible of a minority as you think.

They existed but I don't know how common they were. I don't have an answer for you on the commonness of multi-shot pistols in 1791.

Here's Scalia's argument from Heller on this point:
&gt; Some have made the argument, bordering on the frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment. We do not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, e.g., Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 849 (1997), and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, e.g., Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27,  35–36 (2001), the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.

This is where I see Scalia as being more of an originalist than Gorsuch's textualist.

It's possible that a strict textualist would agree that multi-shot pistols could be banned under the second Amendment. I think it's more likely, though, that the textualist would consider multi-shot pistols within the scope of the meaning of ""arms"" in 1791--that if someone walked up with a multishot pistol, they would be said to be ""bearing arms"". But yes, that leaves open the question of whether the second Amendment was actually about arming a militia or about personal self-defense.",,changemyview,7,2022,1
2349,ieinj1s,t3_vo0j2u,t1_ieb6rbj,7/1/22 16:57,distractonaut,,,1,FALSE,,public,t5_2w2s8,FALSE,FALSE,"The wage gap isn't as simple as plucking a man and a woman working the same job and comparing what they get paid. There are a lot of factors involved - most of which don't involve implicit discrimination the way people would assume the wage gap would have to work.

&gt;They work fewer hours

Often, this is because women are still taking on more of the domestic and childcare duties in the home. This can perhaps be explained by 'the mother needs to breastfeed' in the very beginning, however we see that it tends to continue beyond that initial period - a lot of people assume 'women are just better at that childcare stuff' when in reality they just had the opportunity to learn a lot quicker being the sole parent home with the baby right at the beginning. 

Workplaces can support this issue by making sure that both parents have the opportunity to take parental leave regardless of gender, and making offices friendly towards things like breastfeeding (e.g. stay at home dad brings baby in during working mum's lunch break for a feed) and pumping. Companies providing childcare (or the government supporting cheaper childcare in general) also helps a lot with women returning to work.

The problem with mothers taking a lot of time off for child-rearing (many return to work only part time or work reduced hours so they can be home when kids get home from school etc) is that they then don't get to progress in their career as quickly. So, even if mum and dad started off with the same career and the same pay, because of the time taken off work having kid number 1 by the time kid number 2 arrives dad could already be making more money. And it just makes sense for dad to keep working while mum stays home again, since that will mean more money for the family. And so it goes on. Women are also more likely to look for jobs that have non-salary benefits like flexibility and closeness to home (things that help when you have kids) while men are more likely to look just at salary and potential for advancement.

Of course, there are other issues as well. [Careers that are typically considered more 'feminine' tend to be paid less.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2019/04/01/the-gender-pay-gap-and-the-career-choice-myth/?sh=33f390a2114a) This isn't about women choosing 'easier' work or preferring certain types of work - it's that when a field is dominated by women, the work is valued less by society. The example in that article is primary school teaching - should be considered a very important role and is very difficult but paid very low.

A lot of people argue that women are just 'choosing' jobs that pay less- but again there is more to it than that. Even in school, gender bias is in effect. There are studies (will try to track them down if you want) that show that teachers can just assume boys will be better at STEM subjects than girls, and that this bias can actually affect girls' enthusiasm for and performance in those subjects. One study I remember reading about in [Cordelia Fine's book 'Delusions of Gender'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusions_of_Gender) had teachers say before a test that boys tend to perform better in that test - in the control group where they said nothing boys and girls performed the same, but when girls were told they wouldn't do as well they performed worse than boys.

This continues in university and job-seeking too. If you're a girl trying to get into certain fields but most of your classmates and professors are male, then when you get to to job-hunting stage most people in leadership roles are men, wouldn't this be kinda discouraging?

Then, there are issues with women actually breaking into those higher paid fields or leadership roles. Implicit bias again comes into play - there was a study where resumes were sent to apply for STEM jobs that were identical except for the names - the ones with male names got more responses. Implicit bias can be present in the interviewing as well - when mostly men are at the levels in the company in charge of hiring there might be a mindset of 'will she fit into the culture here?' that might give women a disadvantage in a male-dominated company. 

Another issue is the way men and women are socialised differently around assertiveness and leadership qualities.

Does it?

These are some of the most prominent students of history in high office in the US, and to be honest most of them were atrocious.

Where has it been shown? Which leaders have been possesed of an unbiased understanding of history? 

&gt; His lack of knowledge about the history of the Middle East and the partitioning of the Ottomon Empire that was there prevented him to foresee the catastrophe that had arose when trying to install a new government in Iraq and Afghanistan, especially Afghanistan.

So George W. Bush's lack of knowledge of the Ottoman Empire lead to the failure of nation-building in Afghanistan, a country that was never part of the Ottoman Empire? I guess I don't follow that. How would Bush's decision-making have been different if he had an in-depth understanding of the Edict of Gulhane? 

&gt;Then, there was W. Bush's really ill-informed allegations as to why Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda had been pissed off for so long. He claimed that they were jealous about America's freedoms, and that they wanted to att ack the US just for the sake of that. 

That was a speech. Do you think that was representative of his actual analysis of the situation in the Middle East? 

&gt;Maybe he should have known about how pissed off the about Arab world was about the really unfair terms that were struck after during partitioning of the Ottoman Empire?

Can you draw the line for me between Sykes-Picot and Islamist extremism in the early 2000's? 

&gt; Maybe after solely focusing on capturing bin Laden, he could have diverted his attention to solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by making them compromise with each other on equal terms?

How exactly would that work? 

&gt;Now,this was way before the Iraq War, but still, LBJ's administration still could have at least dug into the history of Vietnam. Not even that,the history of trying to invade a country with incredibly tough terrain to traverse. This has been proven time and time again with the Roman empire trying to invade the deeply forested Germanic lands and the Mongol Empire trying to invade the tropical and islandic nations. 

The Romans didn't have napal, and the US didn't lose the war in Vietnam because it's fleet was smashed by storms. How exactly would this knowledge have done anything to help LBJ make his decision?

&gt; He could have just played a mediator role for the two installed governments in Korea to work out their differences and find a compromise according to the Korean people's wishes. This could have prevented the bloodshed that ultimately did occur in the Korean War.

How? What could he have done? 

&gt;-Don't get me wrong,but Obama had quite the knowledge in law and community organizing around current affairs, and multiple documentaries of him have acknowledged that he was quite a gifted student when it came to law, but there was no mention of history. However, in the wake of the bank bailouts during Bush's last year, he should of at least known how pissed America's working class were. This would have been a perfect opportunity for him to utilize the bully pulpit , in order to rally the people to garner support for his agenda. I think he truly misinterpreted the reason why Americans overwhelming voted for him. It was not because he was Black, but because he purported to be someone who was anti-corruption and status quo for the wealthy and elites. This is nothing new. In fact, he could have drawn parallels from the Gilded Age, whereas as Teddy Roosevelt utilized the bully pulpit during similar times.

Obama should have been a better president isn't really a great argument for a focus on history. 

&gt;In Putin's case, he obviously has no clue about how it has been really hard for empires in the past to govern their colonies in which its own inhabitants do not want the invading army there.

I mean except for all of Russian history. Moscow became a regional power by colonizing its enemies.

People dont like or shame people for being fat because they view it as being ""ugly"". But ugly, is not a clearly identifiable trait. That is my primary issue with trying to integrate it into the BP movement. It is either already apart of it, or to nebulous to not be clearly identifiable and something to say, look, shut the fuck up about this thing. it is not the big is beautiful movement, it is the body positivity movement. 

It ultimately is the, hey dont be a fucking cunt to people because they are not Jennifer Lawrence or Chris Evans. But you focus initially on traits and features people clearly identifiably shame as a culture at large. Obesity, malformations, and scars are clear things people have a ""shame"" towards, or are viewed negatively. 

But pointing at someone and saying, YOU ARE UGLY! when ugly is widely subjective. Which we are also trying to say that everyone is beautiful and different in their own way and to accept people as who they are. Means inherently that ugly, being the opposite end of ugly(which there is a difference between, beautiful, not-beautiful, not-ugly, and ugly) means that it inherently would be a state that is non-existent within the movement. 

It is attempting to remove that concept of a group, or as an inherent capacity people possess. I am not a beautiful person, but that doesnt mean I am ugly, or think I am ugly. I can think I am ugly but have 30% of people say they would consider me beautiful. 

A large part of the body positivity movement as I understand as see it, at least at its core, is to remove the concept of beautiful and ugly as defined objective truth. To not make the concept of beautiful based on a BMI or all 4 functioning limbs. Or a face without acid burns. Or anything of that sort. To show that, having any of those previous things I mentioned and more, does not make you ugly. 

It is an attempt to abolish ""ugly"" by any objective standard. So an attempt to try and integrate ugly, when you are trying to get rid of the concept of it and have people who would say, but you are not ugly? Not as some patronizing thing. But as them being fully truly honest about their opinion, makes it very hard to try and make a clear coherent message

Did I say that it is as simple as plucking a man and a woman working the same job and comparing what they get paid?

&gt;however we see that it tends to continue beyond that initial period

Part of it is because women want to do it. Lots of them will choose to stay with the baby over going to work. Does this come as a surprise?

&gt;when in reality they just had the opportunity to learn a lot quicker being the sole parent home with the baby right at the beginning.

Evolutionary biology proves that your statement is false.

&gt;The problem with mothers taking a lot of time off for child-rearing (many return to work only part time or work reduced hours so they can be home when kids get home from school etc) is that they then don't get to progress in their career as quickly.

I agree, but again, part of it is because it's the women's choice. Lots of them will choose to stay with the baby over going to work even if this means that they will not get to progress in their career as quickly.

&gt;A lot of people argue that women are just 'choosing' jobs that pay less-

Because it is true. Women on average, choose jobs that are easier and pay less than their men counterparts. This is demonstrated in the Gender-equality paradox. The more the country is gender-equal, the more women tend to choose less-paying jobs and enroll less in STEM fields.

&gt;There are studies (will try to track them down if you want) that show that teachers can just assume boys will be better at STEM subjects than girls, and that this bias can actually affect girls' enthusiasm for and performance in those subjects.

Seems like a poorly conducted study, how do you arrive at such conclusions with proper study control? It is well known in 2022 that boys are at a significant disadvantage when it comes to academic institutions which are part of why the gap between men and women in universities is increasing, but the STEM enrollment rates aren't. Even though there is a huge encouragement for women nowadays to enroll in STEM fields. And again, according to the gender-equal paradox, the more the country is gender-equal, the more women tend to choose less-paying jobs and enroll less in STEM fields.

&gt;Another issue is the way men and women are socialised differently around assertiveness and leadership qualities. Traits like assertiveness, ambition, and dominance are often viewed positively in men but negatively in women. Men showing anger are seen as 'leaders', women showing anger are seen as less competent. Men with these traits are more likely to be hired into leadership roles, while women have to tread a very fine line between 'masculine' and 'feminine' traits to be considered. Because of these differences too, men are more likely to ask for a pay rise than women, and men are more likely to apply for roles they are not qualified for.

Again, evolutionary biology disagrees with your argument. And the gender-equal paradox proves it to be false. The more the country is gender-equal, the more women tend to choose less-paying jobs and enroll less in STEM fields.

&gt;the wage gap absolutely exists.

Reddit is not a public institution, nor is any given subreddit. Superficially speaking the platform is publicly driven i.e. managed by the users, but the structure of moderation necessarily means that all subreddits are by definition private spaces. Many choose to keep their subs completely open for any number of reasons, such as differences of opinion and promoting debate, but the opposite is also true. Many create subs specifically for private or heavily restricted utility. Any sub that operates as a public forum is run that way by intentional choices to create that space for interaction. Spoken succinctly, auto-bans don't *need* to make sense.

Re-interpreting your claim, I imagine it's perhaps more apt to say that subs who claim to support diversity of opinion, or anything which nominally would suggest they would encourage spreading of their own beliefs are hypocritical if they use a blanket ban based on participation in a given sub. On a surface I don't necessarily disagree, but the reality is more complicated. 

All subs have different purposes and even the same sub can change drastically depending on its moderation. Maybe one might assume a trans-affirming sub might want to ""convert"" or at least remain open to those who may have participated in a terf sub, but the reality is that they have no obligation to do that or even maintain an open forum of any kind, including logical. If the sub is meant to simply create a safe space for members of the community, it can make perfect sense to isolate themselves from spaces which are predicated on discrimination. The same can be said of any ideology and an opposing counterpart, as with  TheDonald as discussed in other comments.

Those points aside, one additional caveat is again based on moderation. You might be entirely right, and one specific sub has banned another sub despite there being no logical benefit or it even being contrary to the goal of the sub. The thing is, people are wrong sometimes. Mods are people with a set of tools. Maybe they're too lazy and rely on auto-ban. Maybe they don't understand what a sub is actually about. Maybe they aren't behaving in accordance with the goals of the community. Any of these could occur. Here again, there is no need for it to ""make sense"". It's just people using a tool.

Ultimately, it's entirely case by case. There are any number of logical reasons to blanket ban a particular community. It happens in real life as well, though certainly it functions differently usually. That is just the reality of spaces being managed by individuals. Individuals are by no means logical.

Abortionists literally ha signs with that message. What the fuck do you mean strawman?

\&gt;, you don't seem to understand the difference between a woman who desires to have a baby and one who doesn't

Why would that be relevant at all? Does the woman wanting the fetus somehow grant it the status of a child? Why would a woman's ( By the way... what even is a woman?) emotional state have any bearing at all on whether or not a fetus is a child/human being?

\&gt; Do you think you feel equal loss if you do that and if you on purpose go to take your car to be demolished?

Your example is flawed. No where in your scenario is the question of the car's humanity brought into question.

By calling the Fetus of a woman (?) who wants it a child you have delineated a fetus from a child (aka a human) why would the mothers intent to have the offspring determine whether or not that thing is a human being (who you are not allowed to murder) Or else, when exactly does a fetus become a child?

\&gt; You should understand the difference between a miscarriage and an abortion as well.

What is the difference? Not in terms of the mothers sorrow (which shouldn't exist for a pro abortionist mother), What is the practical, diffence? 

IS there really no difference between wrecking a car and shredding a fetus to you?",,changemyview,7,2022,1

When did I claim that?

Ya, I'd gathered that. I'm asking you to justify that with concrete affirmative examples rather than vague unfalsifiables.

When did I say that? 

&gt;Well, it's been many decades in the process.

Many centuries, some might say. 

&gt;The partitioning of the Ottoman Empire was done in a way that appeared as though not much consideration was given towards the Arab people.

Expand on that. What do you mean? 

&gt; There were, in fact, policy decisions made by the US government that were slanted towards the Israelis.

Such as? 

&gt;Bush Jr failed to take this into account, and get at the root cause.

How so? 

&gt;Well, I believe it does; because Obama had, infact, was weak in his utilization of the bully pulpit.

You keep saying that, but as of yet you have not expanded on what you mean. 

&gt;He could have raised working class consciousness, much like how Teddy did during the Gilded Age( very similar era to today)

How could he have done that? He created an electoral coalition that turned away from the Democrat's traditional working class base and instead focused on college-educated women and racial minorities.

First of all, knowing why you were elected has no bearing on how well one understands history. You're suggesting that if Obama had a totally objective view of history, he would have had *your* view of history, which fundamentally misunderstands how the study of history works. But more specifically, I have to ask for any evidence that Obama thought he was elected because he was Black. Any reasonable reading of that period will suggest that the Bush administration was incredibly divisive, and that at the time of his election Obama was under the impression that his voters wanted a uniter. I'd be shocked if you could find any source anywhere that suggests Obama believed his election was because he was Black, that's (ironically) radically revisionist.

A more thorough reading of the circumstances will suggest that Obama wanted to reshape the economy in profound ways, to prevent such a deep recession from happening again. Again, looking to an unbiased reading history, [TARP was contemporaneously considered a success](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/42135.html%3f_amp=true), and we saw less volatility in the markets with greater pressures during COVID than we did in 08 recession.

Isn't arguing with people an important part of politics? How else are we going to be able to change the world without convincing people to support our cause?

Regardless, while debate in high school is supposed to be structured and a useful academic exercise, to convince people in a political context often requires disregarding the debate skills from high school.

What reasons do you think Obama had to believe that should, specifically, follow in Teddy Roosevelt's footsteps? And what makes you think Obama didn't know about Teddy Roosevelt? Because you're making a very specific claim: Obama didn't follow in Roosevelt's footsteps because he didn't know about them. But Obama understood Roosevelt's presidency just fine:

&gt;[And in 1910, Teddy Roosevelt came here to Osawatomie and he laid out his vision for what he called a New Nationalism. “Our country,” he said, “…means nothing unless it means the triumph of a real democracy…of an economic system under which each man shall be guaranteed the opportunity to show the best that there is in him.” (Applause.)(https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/12/06/remarks-president-economy-osawatomie-kansas) 

&gt;Now, for this, Roosevelt was called a radical. He was called a socialist -- (laughter) -- even a communist. But today, we are a richer nation and a stronger democracy because of what he fought for in his last campaign: an eight-hour work day and a minimum wage for women -- (applause) -- insurance for the unemployed and for the elderly, and those with disabilities; political reform and a progressive income tax. (Applause.)

I don't know how you define ""bully pulpit."" Is it number of speeches? A quick proxy is that [Wikipedia counts more significant speeches from Obama than any other president](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:United_States_presidential_speeches), by a wide margin. Is it bold public moves against opposing lawmakers? [Because Obama did that, too](https://www.politico.com/story/2010/01/obama-to-address-house-gop-031408). So what metric do you want to use to measure the use of the bully pulpit, specifically? Or is it possible that when people have more power to critique presidents, the role of the bully pulpit is less effective? 

Ultimately, your argument falls apart because Obama knew the history of the gilded age perfectly well. Well enough to understand in what ways 2008 was distinct from it. If your conception of history is merely looking for the closest analogue and doing that, then you're going to miss the factors that brought us (into the present) into the same quagmire that causes us to look for historical analogues in the first place.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

I believe it's been widely observed (as in this [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolved_(film)) ) that the norms of high school policy is not at all designed with the intention of mirroring the type of discourse norms/debates one should expect to encounter in public life. Rather, it's intended to cultivate inherently valuable patterns of valid reasoning and argument assessment that helps the student to more critically evaluate arguments for themselves, while also providing them with some public speaking skills. Moreover, Patricia Roberts-Miller, while discussing argumentation education more broadly, also makes the point that we teach students more idealized forms of reasoning not because we expect that this idealized world awaits our students, but so that students will demand that their elected representatives emulate these norms of reasoning and argumentation. Establishing an unachievable ideal (see Habermas's ""Ideal speech situation"") is then a means to helping people to identify when and how people are using faulty or unethical arguments or persuasive appeals.

I would agree that supplementing this normative focus with more diversified knowledge of how deliberation occurs across contexts and communities is crucial to helping one adapt to new audiences or figure out to proceed in messier argumentative situations. However, this doesn't signal an inherent fault in the taught norms themselves.

2. I take issue with your characterization of many of your examples as ""debate"". Lying for political purposes, or bad faith gish-galloping for example, are only operating within a debate in a very loose sense. A broader education in rhetoric broadly construed, may better account for how this language operates than thinking of these as part of a traditional argument genre like debate.

3. I'm curious what you mean by ""**lose**...debates"" in your final set of examples. First, because I would be careful of characterizing most argumentative situations as win/lose agonistic encounters. As I suggested before, I don't think high school debate ever claimed to be the ideal approach to all situations where disagreement is present (see Douglas Walton's list of types of dialogue). The general goal of most arguments should be knowledge-sharing and critique in which all interlocutors benefit (see Daniel H. Cohen's [tedx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTN9Nx8VYtk&amp;t=373s)).

Second, it seems like you didn't lose, so much as you reached an impasse with with people who had different epistemic foundations than yourself. That's fine. Sometimes you can then move into a discussion about epistemology/authority etc., but very often the means to persuasion are simply not available with those people, so you just have to call it a day. In those cases, debate hasn't failed, because debate wasn't entirely possible to begin with. Not everyone can be persuaded in a one-off encounter.

I will go so far as to say I think curricula and education can do much more to prepare students to better address the epistemic foundations for their reasoning, rather than assuming that everyone accepts, for example, scientific institutions. However, I think this is less a failure of things like high school debate instruction than a sign that they see their goal as prepping students to either engage in academic and juridical contexts or to make their representatives more accountable, than to dissuade their neighbors of conspiracy theories.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

In court, judges don't let you get away with a lot of the ""dirty"" tactics that you describe. While oral arguments and hearings are an extremely formalized setting, they are still vitally important. 

2) The defense to a strawman or red herring is to point out the truth. This is easier done in in-person arguments. Unfortunately, most of our political discourse today is done through the media, which is committed to ""both-sides-ing"" everything. The problem is that the arbiter is not truly neutral in this debate. The only way to reduce strawmanning in politics is to reform the media. I'm not sure what that looks like. 

3) The discussion about the other rights that could be potentially lost with the *Dobbs* decision is *not* a slippery slope argument. Slippery slope arguments require that the warned dangers are not the direct logical outcome of something. In this case, with Justice Thomas broadcasting the intent to revisit decisions, it is no longer a mere slippery slope. It is a stated intention that they are criticizing. 

4) The Gish Gallop is a relatively new debate tactic, so ideal defenses haven't yet been defined.  Online, you can do it by breaking up and rebutting every single point with every single reply. That's what I do most often on here and why practically every post I make on CMV has numbered paragraphs. In person, you have to be assertive and insist that your opponent give you time to respond to one thing at a time. You will have to be rude. You will probably have to talk over them. Once somebody starts with the full-on verbal gish gallop talking over you, it is unlikely that their mind will be changed, so really, you are speaking to the audience, not to that person at that point. 

5) When somebody comes to a discussion unwilling to have their mind changed, it's not really a debate. It's not really even an argument. It's two people talking past each other. Conspiratorial thinkers cannot usually be reasoned with because they discount shared reality. In any argument, you have to have a certain number of shared axioms. You usually don't have those with conspiracists. You didn't lose that debate because there was no real debate. The same goes for your climate denial argument.

6) I'm a pretty new mod to CMV. I've been learning a lot in the last few weeks about why our rules are structured as they are. We have extensive rules in this sub to ensure actually productive debate. That means that, at least here, you can learn some pretty effective ways of persuading people. Good debate happens when two opposing parties enter with good faith and with a shared set of views about what is and isn't fair game. This sub strives to do that.

Traditional digital currency is managed thru a ledger held at a central entity, usually a bank. This central entity has the authority to determine which transactions are legit and which aren't. When moving to digital currency without a central entity, you run into several problems because of the lack of this authority, chief of which is the double spend problem. If anyone can say they're making a transaction, what's there to stop Alice from paying Bob some money and then later paying Carol that same money?

Well, the way that was solved was with the blockchain: everyone spends a bunch of processing power trying to solve some meaningless calculation, and the person who solves the calculation gets the temporary authority to determine which transactions of a particular block are legit (along with some coins). If those transactions still seem fishy to other users, they won't chain off that block, they'll chain off some other block minted by some other who also solved that meaningless calculation. This would also render the coins of the rogue minter worthless, so they have every incentive to actually police those transactions they're adding.

Even as someone who is mostly skeptical of crypto, I have to admit this is a very elegant solution to this problem, in theory.

----

What in turn is the use case of decentralized digital currency? Well, mostly buying illegal things. It's dangerous and difficult to use your ordinary money in your ordinary bank account for drugs, because a big legitimate financial institution has its eye on those transactions. Certainly they'll never willingly let you spend your money on drugs (so, no Paypal or anything that requires the merchant to sign up for the service), and even Venmo leaves a paper trail you'd rather not have.

In the more legitimate case, it's also often easier to buy porn with crypto, and will only get easier as moralizing Christian groups intimidate traditional payment processors to stop dealing with porn sites. This has already happened a bunch and will likely to continue to happen in the future.

To generalize these use cases, crypto is useful in situations where the authority of existing payment processors is being or is likely to be abused to limit your ability to spend your money.

(The biggest problem here is that the implementation details of almost all existing crypto are such that they are very much not useful as money, and much more ""useful"" as arbitrary investments. Specifically, they are almost all extremely deflationary, instead of stable to slightly inflationary like you'd want with an actual currency.)",,changemyview,7,2022,1

&gt;So perhaps I simply should write off these people as closed-minded, and therefore, impossible to convince whether via proper debate or any other means?

I would object to ""any other means"". Just because someone isn't responsive (or may even double-down on their position) during formalized debate genres doesn't entail that they are permanently entrenched in those views, just that a different logic is at play. Things like deep distrust of institutions or anti-lgbt attitudes are rarely arrived at through impartial reflection or debate, but more.often a culmination of many experiences, attitudes, anxieties that make those beliefs useful or desirable for making sense of their problems.
In such cases the only evidence that will result in a shift in these attitudes may require long-term exposure (think of Daryl Davis' befriending of KKK members). 
Very often people don't engage in good faith because from the outset they don't trust the people who are trying to persuade them. If any arguments you make are already being filtered through a series of alarms, then developing a relationship with that person through other means is a precondition to any meaningful future dialogue.
Reducing other stressors in their life that may hinder thinking on a subject may also help (think of how Trump enabled a struggling white working class to blame immigrants for their condition).
If people are generally scared, vulnerable, or unhappy, then they probably will be more receptive to messaging that validates these feelings.

The best arguments, then, are sometimes just love, which isn't easily accounted for in internet debate, unfortunately.

The abhorrent part of the “carve outs” to me is that a baby of incest or rape is less worthy than another baby. 

That said, I don’t think a woman who opts to abort before the baby could live with medical care is “killing.” And whether or not she’s making a moral decision or taking the advice of doctors, I definitely don’t think there should be regulatory restrictions on abortion.

edit: I’d also add that there’s a bit of hypocrisy involved when you will allow abortion for a fetus of incest but not a fetus who has proven extreme disability or some kind of terminal disease.

&gt;  
&gt;That's not what I mean and I'm pretty sure you know that. There is something called the ""the tyranny of the majority"". This is one of the reasons you hardly ever have a simple majority rule over a large geographic areas. You don't want a situation where a large cohesive block is ignored because they are in the minority.

There are plenty of minority groups in the US (african americans, low income americans, disabled people, etc.) I don't see why rural americans are unique in that regards. The definition of urban, suburban, and rural all exist on a gradient but the urban population is a minority as well (a bit less than a third). If any group is to dominate in a popualr vote, it would be the suburbanites.

Of course, this is assuming that rural america is united by a common interest with the same being true of urban america. I don't know about rural america but urban america is very diverse. You have rich people and poor people (NYC is the city with the most billionaires but it also has a large homeless population). NYC and LA are melting pots of diversity.

On a final note, if your concern is to give the lesser group equal representation, why are you paying special attention to rural america when plenty of marginalized live in the cities? In fact, many EC opponents make a point that it hurts racial minorities. After all, most african americans who don't live in the south live in big cities and those who do live in the south are drowned out by the white republicans in the area.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

But you can’t beat electric in efficiency unless you’ve got some godlike factory out there like the Italian NASA, and if they could’ve they would’ve.

I agree that while Lambo has VW bankrolling a quicker rollout and selling more hybrids until then, I’m sure Ferrari’s taking its sweet time tweaking around the garage to keep it a Ferrari. I’d have to be stupid to think they made an automatic F40 probably for some Arabian Prince without keeping their soul, just like they are with the next hybrids. We already know they’re retooling the plant, slowly, to go electric some point after 2025 (not by 2025 as they’re claiming generically), so I can only imagine what their Skunk Works are doing in Maranello…

To wrap up, Ferrari probably will never let consumers or racing trends completely dictate their art. Like you said they’ve adapted before as have buyers. And they have resources, access and respect most exotics just can’t rely on (other than a massive German conglomerate as an ATM). F1 in general is redefining and tackling these challenges.

Anyway, my personal philosophical outlook places high value on something called ""disentropy density"" and NYC, specifically Manhattan, has one of the highest values of disentropy density anywhere in the world due to its population density, wealth, cultural significance, and it's collective emphasis on integrating nature with urban design. New York's architecture, parks, and Greenways are what amaze me the most (besides it's people of course). To me, NYC is the most important thing Humans have ever produced. 

Now, to address your concern about the filth, homelessness, and gloominess you described...everything beautiful produces shit, aka entropy flux. The more beautiful a thing, the larger the shits it takes. Doggos take small shits, people slightly larger shits, and wow, New York probably shits out an entire town sized blob of pure entropic refuse on a daily basis (and I'm including the junkies rotting on the streets as part of that turd). Does that mean NYC is sick or a bad place to live... No... It's a byproduct of it's beauty. It may not be something that everyone can handle though. Many people don't want or need to be in the center of a highly compressed disentropy density. It takes a lot of spiritual energy to enjoy that, as the city's large entropy flux flows through you and past you, constantly challenging your homeostasis and pushing you to grow (metaphorically). If it's not for you, then that's understandable. But there are some people (like me) who become depressed if they aren't in a city like New York. I personally never felt ""at home"" until I started living here.

&gt;Second, psychological studies have shown that beyond certain point (which most developed industrial nations have already overtaken in their average income), the absolute material welfare matters a lot less to the happiness of people than their relative welfare.

Right but our argument is really about the best method to get material welfare for people. 

You want a productive economy and socialism does not help in that regard. (to be continued in next paragraph).

&gt;Yes, absolute GDP matters, but when it comes to top countries, it's actually the ones (Nordic countries) that have found the sweetspot between taking advantage of the free market economy of driving the economy and socialism spreading the welfare more equally that are topping it.

This is probably our biggest disagreement. You see very wealthy capitalist countries. Who can afford very wide safety nets. Let's forget about Norway for a second because they are a model of what you do with natural resource wealth. But all the other Nordic countries appear to be doing it with brains more so than anything else. 

You see socialism as essential to their success. I see it as a hindrance. Meaning these countries would be even wealthier if they focused more on supply side economics. 

[https://www.heritage.org/index/ranking](https://www.heritage.org/index/ranking)

These countries also have better Free Market ratings than America. That is essentially how much the government gets in the way of business. Nordic countries are very small business friendly. More so than United States. 

I honestly believe that the sweet spot they found is how to get the government the hell out of the economy. Also Nordic people tend to be very intelligent. Let's not kid ourselves. America is very top heavy in terms of talent. We have the most talented people on the planet living here. But also a whole lot of lazy fucks. I'm almost 100% certain a Nordic system with that demographic would not work. The American lazy fucks would tear it into pieces. 

I admit I need to do more research on this. Besides the Free Market ratings I don't have good data to support my claim that the Nordic countries succeed DESPITE socialism not because of socialism.

This is a somewhat biased article on Swedish experiment with socialism. They totally did a 180 when they saw what it was doing to the economy. 

&gt;. But that's the thing, because I'm lucky to have certain talents and skills, I think it's wrong that I get all the benefit from that. I didn't choose to have them. I didn't make any effort to get the DNA from my parents, the environment where I grew up, etc.

Finally we disagree here as well. You should get paid for your talent.

Because...and this is important. The economy is not a zero sum game. When you produce or help produce a good or a service. You're not taking away from anyone. You may be taking away market share from your competitor. But the economy overall is wealthier for it. You're just adding you're not taking away. 

So what you're saying really is that you should be penalized for your talent. Because you produce 10 times more than some 80 IQ janitor you should be forced to earn less than him. Because he is unfortunate and what not.

You don't build a thriving economy like that. I'm sorry you just don't. You can't pander to the lowest denominator.

You keep asserting as such but fail to provide evidence to your claim. How is the dictionary failing to reflect the popular definition? Where is the citation to popular use? You are harping on about my reference to the dictionary **and** explanations in scientific communication context but provide no evidence. 

&gt;Try making this argument in a legitimate academic context.

I am not a sociologist, but I doubt their definition is any different given there are examples of societies structured around polyandrous polygamy. Having talked to and taken classes with [evolutionary biologists](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/polygamy), they also refer to polygamy as gender-neutral. [Anthropologically](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118924396.wbiea1377), it is defined as I have given. I think I would do just fine with this assertion in legitimate academic context.

&gt;That's fairly significant considering I have been in polyamorous relationships and spend plenty of time researching patriarchal cults like LDS. 

There is nothing significant to you having been in polyamorous relationships and focussed only on LDS-style polygamy. They are biases, not reflections of how the world works or what polygamy actually means. People use the word polygamy outside of polygamous/polyamorous relationships.

Again, you are confusing examples of polygamy with being the defining nature of polygamy. I provided examples of polyandrous polygamy in Tibet, and there are [many others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyandry#Known_cases) throughout history. You continue to ignore it. Then we continue in circles about how you have no evidence and you don't believe in the validity of a dictionary. **Just because you have not heard of it does not mean it doesn't exist.** You may use the term to exclusively refer to polygynous marriages, but the evidence does not support that being the accepted definition in society as a whole.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

If human pregnancy was simple - such as getting pregnant one day and popping out an egg the next day - the abortion debate wouldn't exist.

There are many medical problems which can complicate pregnancies to the point where a fetus isn't viable, but technically not dead at the moment, so terminating the pregnancy would legally qualify as abortion and not miscarriage.

Especially if used in combination with Universal Basic Credit, you can really choose how much you are willing to spend on this policy and can increase it incrementally as you see results.

i dont subscribe to any particular tax theory as i have not done much real, quantitative study. i do believe in capitalism, but i believe it can be improved with broad, simple social programs. 

its true that, if the rewards of any investment or success are taken away to only award thin benefits, then people wont bother with risk taking or extra work. 

however, that does not make taxing someone categorically wrong, especially if they purchase defense, security, insurance, and even defense of the concepts of property, freedom, and business. 

I prioritize efficiency over ideology, and dont believe that funding such programs are anti capitalism, actually precisely the opposite. if a program is correct, efficient and improves access, its plausible that incomes to be taxed are higher in the first place and the net is positive--especially if you consider *real* incomes that take into account effects such as improved buying power and resource utilization.

this is why i disagree with 'you cant tax jill to pay jane'. we all belong in society and all deserve to succeed with human progress.

note i have already offered a delta for that i agree numbers should have been more relevant to my post, but with this perspective in mind i am pretty confident it is feasible if we scrap price-distorting programs, improve tax reporting, and simplify the tax code to reduce corporate loopholes and discourage excessive debt. this money can either go to direct income or reduced non-usurous full access prejudice-free loans with finitely accumulating interest",,changemyview,7,2022,1

There's a ""germinal evil"" if you will, that makes it seem more acceptable that the woman should be able to dissociate from the pregnancy. I don't think it's any more or less acceptable. The baby has the same worth any which way.

Of course we should do everything possible from progressive standpoints to minimize the amount of abortion that needs to take place. When they occur, though, the calculus needs more weight on the suffering of the person being denied that abortion/control. Most people getting abortions for reasons other than medically-necessary/life-threatening ones are likely making the choice not to bring a child into the world that they will be unable to support. The child and the mother will suffer for the adverse conditions. It impacts the whole family.

I feel like the crowd that looks to restrict abortion from a ""deal with the consequences of your actions"" angle are too ready to accept vengeance as a modus operandi.

The picture painted of a loose woman galavanting around getting herself pregnant and aborting without a care in the world is a constructed boogeyman. Sure maybe some get an abortion due to irresponsibility, but is it any significant proportion?

Anyway, the comparison is meant to highlight how culpability plays into your argument. You seem very fixated on the fact that the mother’s choice to have sex is what makes the fetus have a medical need to borrow her body, which you’re then saying revokes her right to decide if the fetus can continue using her body. This would be like someone stabbing someone (causing a medical need) and therefore being forced to give part of their body to solve the medical situation they created. 

But maybe that’s not the crux of your argument so I’ll address the other part:

You seem to think that the only *active* action happening here is the mother removing an embryo or fetus from her body. *But the embryo or fetus is also actively occupying and draining nutrients from the mother’s body.* Pregnancy is draining and quite dangerous! This is an *active* process. 

You’re saying that the government can’t compel anyone to give up part of their body, but it can bar people from doing things. Well since the embryo or fetus is actively taking the woman’s body every single day, why shouldn’t she be allowed to stop it from doing that if she wants?

Question 1
“Why does there  have to be a consequence for sex this assumes that sex not done for procreation is a bad thing.”

Response 1
I think the answer to the question why is there a consequence? Well because you had sex knowing the risk it’s not like you were in the dark all this means is that the person in question is unwilling to take responsibility for their actions. “Murder is the unjustifiable killing of a person.” If you are killing a fetus out of pure convenience and no other real reason I would consider that murder because you are killing a person for no justifiable reason. 


Question 2:

“Your view assumes that the fetus is worth
saving as soon as the sperm hits the egg. At that stage of development, the fetus is only a few cells large. Most ethicists would put the human life somewhere later in development - when it can detect pain, or when it can register brain waves. That happens at around 18 weeks, far after Texas' 6-week ban.”



Response 2 : Ultimately when asked the question why is the fetus worth saving? It comes down to the argument of personhood. We have to ask ourselves is the fetus a person and at what point can it be considered a person . You said “Most ethicists would put the human life somewhere later in development - when it can detect pain, or when it can register brain waves.“ I don’t think brain waves or pain is necessary to consider someone a person and even if it was that doesn’t make the killing justifiable if we know they will wake up.  For example if you see a man in a comma with hardly any brain activity  and you know he will wake up in 9 months time can you just pull the plug just because he feels no pain and has hardly in brain activity? Of course not because it’s not a matter of is he conscious or does he  feels pain it’s a matter of is he a person and is pulling plug justifiable. Another question would be if I stop a doctor from using a defibrillators I did nothing wrong because that person felt no pain and literally had no brain activity because they are dead. You would disagree because this action has no justification why stop someone from being brought back despite no brain activity at the moment unless it’s not a matter of brains activity but person hood and consequentialism. 

Question 3: “Having a child is incredibly demanding on the mother. The mother may have gotten a college degree that she can no longer use because she will have to, as a single parent, take care of a child. She may have to quit her job. Having a child may mean that she is a less attractive prospect for marriage. Mothers should not be forced into this situation without an extremely compelling countervailing interest.”

Response 3: I mean this comes down to responsibility again the man and the women who chose to have sex new their was ultimately a risk of having kids if she didn’t want to go through with pregnancy she could had got her tubes tied or the man could had got medically castrated in the since he can no longer produce viable sperm. It comes down to the laziness. it cost almost as much to get your tubes tied   As it is to get an abortion. At that point if every time she got pregnant she aborted the baby she would had spent more money than what it would had cost to get her tubes tied.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

I don’t think human life should be taken for pure convenience sake. “Murder is unjustified intentional killing a person.”  If the abortion is unjustified and is intentionally done that is murder.  

Abortion should be a choice if it is justified. A justifiable action in terms of abortion would be the following. (Abortion due to medical emergency ie extreme Mental or physical disability’s arising from said birth, The mother or fetuses life being in danger,  The woman is financially unstable to such a degree she cannot afford to take care of the child ie feed, clothe and shelter it without severe financial side affects.

I honestly considered joining up as a teenager because I was relatively poor, and couldn’t afford to go to the schools I wanted to. I decided against it after two of the recruiters gave me the most red of red flags (just as people). I’m happy where I am now.

Most of all, I’m happy the armed forces are moving in a better direction. The people who serve and our veterans deserve better, and changes are being made to do so.

Reddit of all places is the last place the majority of people are crossing on subs to get a different perspective. The amount of people going to another sub for ""another perspective"" make up the minority of users, and half the time they stalk those subs to either argue or then repost information into another subreddit to make fun of/bring attention to.

Could it create an echo chamber? For sure, but that also depends on WHAT and HOW MANY subs are being banned.

When all the Trump subreddits were banned, they migrated over to the conservative subreddit. While there are some decent individuals there, for the most part that subreddit has come to be viewed as a personal echo chamber with any users coming from that sub mainly to cause harm. They have tons of posts that are marked for flaired users only, and a lot of the things they boost have to do wuth topics that the majority of redditors don't agree with/find harmful. Now subs like r/politics doesn't just autoban anyone from conservative, the larger a subreddit is, the less likely they are to do so.

However I can see smaller subreddits doing so as a means of protection. The justiceserved subreddit tends to have a lot of left leaning posts that would directly conflict with the conservative subreddit views, and it's very likely they've had issues with people from said subreddit. In a way, it's fine for them to autoban. 

This is like a vegan subreddit autobanning anyone from pro-meat subreddits when they end result has only ever been problematic. 

Don't think a subreddit has actively gone out of their way to autoban people from a sub they didn't like or it's rare. There's almost always a reason, and your topic regarding the conservative and justiceserved subreddit is like one of the more mainstream complicated/argumentative subreddits to deal with.

On that note, if you want to talk about an exchange of ideas, justiceserved is the last place conservative users should flock to. That subreddit is only for moments of justice, which happen to be left leaning all the time. There is nothing to talk about there, it's just a content subreddit.

1. How do we define “unbiased” history? If you look at many conservative states they’re trying to ban anything associated with Critical Race Theory (in K-12) or otherwise suggesting the U.S. has been anything but a massive utopia since it’s founding. On the flip side in universities, there are many professors who teach that the United States has pretty much been the root of all evil since 1775 (actually went through this with a couple history classes in college…if there was a conservative idea, automatically bad). 

With respect to al Qaeda and bin Laden being pissed at us, it had little to do with the breakup of the Ottoman Empire and more to do with an effective psychological operation we conducted in the 1980s during the Afghan-Soviet War (it helps if people learn modern history too). During that time we convinced the Saudis to fund an insurrection movement and provided the Mujahideen (many who included bin Laden and others who would form al Qaeda) with intelligence training and logistics via Pakistan. We also promoted using religion as a means of motivation, it led them to believe that as true believers God would not let the “evil” Soviet empire  defeat them. The USSR collapsed in 1991, we no longer cared about Afghanistan, and many Mujahideen were no longer welcome home. During Desert Storm the Saudis allowed us to use their land to launch strikes against Iraq. Bin Laden and his believers felt that was an insult against Islam and as a result of God “giving” them the power to destroy the Soviet Union, they felt they could do the same to the U.S.

When you’re talking about the President it’s easy to criticize. He is the decision maker and ultimately the consequences rest with him. But expecting him to know everything in history to make good foreign policy decisions is a fallacy in itself. Should he also have served so he knows how the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs works? And as a diplomat to understand State? Maybe study economics to understand the Treasury? What about law/law enforcement to run Justice? And probably grow up on a farm to understand Agriculture? Truth is the President cannot possibly be an expert. But that’s why he’s surrounded by people who are. The people gathering and preparing intelligence are people on the ground or have extensive education/experience in that area (e.g., diplomats in the Embassy, CIA ops officers on the ground in country, foreign affairs officers in the military, etc.) 

Finally, hindsight is always 20/20. It’s easy to point at failures like Vietnam because we saw it play out. Johnson believed it could be a quick and decisive victory. Bush criticized nation building in his campaign, but when the American people came together after 9/11 asking “how will you prevent this from happening again?” I’m pretty sure his first thought wasn’t nation building. At the same time 1991 showed what happens when you lay waste to Afghanistan and simply cut and run. He was quite literally stuck between a rock and a hard place. Had he done nothing like Clinton, the next 9/11 might have been worse.

Theoretically *both* should be legal because all either definition’s is is either “marriage between multiple people” or “relations between blood relatives.” Neither says anything about issues of consent or power imbalance being *inherent* to them.

In practice though the fact that incest is an umbrella term that also includes parent-child or other intergenerational relationships while polygamy *also* covers one-sided polygyny makes both too big a risk to take to legalize/normalize it for those few equally balanced and truly consensual partnerships. Parent/Child incest and Polygyny are just two drastically problematic and power imbalanced relationship structures for them to ever be safe to give *any* sort of leeway to. (In addition to incest there’s also the inbreeding problem though I argue that can be solved simply by limiting it to queer incestuous couples only like some countries do)

Consent will always be blurry and the risk for abuse high in either Parent/Child incest or Polygyny, it sucks for those equally open polyamorous groups out there like a quad of two straight couples or a fully gay polycule but it also sucks that consenting adult siblings or cousins of a similar age are also being subject to the bad faith actors of international incest and abuse, but sometimes that’s just the road you’ve gotta take for the good of society, having such a laissez-fairy attitude toward either taboo opens up the door for some of extremely abusive and power-imbalanced dynamics.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

Honestly I think what made things different in the 90s and definitely the turn of the millennium was the availability of diverse music. And we really saw that divergence in the 80s. Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie were significantly different from Van Halen, who was different from The Cars and .38 Special. 

If you look at the decades, the 70s were known for disco, the 80s for new wave (or now called retro), and the monikers stopped in the 90s.

This is a tricky one. The Constitution was written intentionally broad because it was understood that not every Right could be foreseen and not every Right should be explicitly stated in the Constitution because that could result in Rights being added or taken away as the opinion of the masses fluctuates and erode the bedrock of the US government by creating legal instability and doubts of integrity. Rights amended to the Constitution also need to be sufficiently broad. Thus, the SC was established with the ""[power of 'judicial review' \[that\] has given the Court a crucial responsibility in assuring individual rights, as well as in maintaining a ""living Constitution"" whose broad provisions are continually applied to complicated new situations.](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/constitutional.aspx)"" Essentially, through precedent, the SC can establish new Rights using the Constitution as a guide, but not the end-all-be-all.

But the SC has overruled previous SC decisions, so the question becomes: if precedent establishes new Constitutional Rights, what is the criteria for revoking those Rights? Should it simply be that the latest justices interpret the Constitution differently? No, because that results in the same tenuous legal outcome as changing the Constitution as the opinion of the masses (who elect representatives in Congress) changes and erodes the stability of our democracy (a very real fear in the current political climate).

The criteria for overruling precedent and revoking a Right should be based in the philosophy of democracy.

[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democracy/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democracy/)

[https://www.civiced.org/lesson-plans/constitutional-democracy](https://www.civiced.org/lesson-plans/constitutional-democracy)

I would say it is as simple as:

* Would *revoking* the Right erode the establishment of general safety of any US citizens?
* Would *maintaining* the Right erode the establishment of general safety of any US citizens?

This is why the 14th amendment was necessary to revoke states Rights to own slaves. Prior to this, negros were not US citizens. However, the 14th amendment does not say ""negros shall not be slaves"". It was intentionally broad to state anyone born in the US is a US citizen and thus protected by US citizen Rights.

The Supreme Court upheld states rights in Plessy v Ferguson which launched the Jim Crow era until another SC decision overruled it in Brown v Board. Some draw parallels to the Dobbs case saying ""liberals only get upset when the SC overturns something they want"". I can't speak for all liberals, but I think the distinction goes back to those 2 questions above.

* Would *revoking* the Right erode the establishment of general safety of any US citizens? No, the safety of white people in general would not be eroded by allowing black people to drink from the same water fountains, sit anywhere on a bus, go to the same school, etc.
* Would *maintaining* the Right erode the establishment of general safety of any US citizens? Yes, because black people were US citizens and the laws created an environment that fostered discrimination by agents of the government, reduced economic opportunity, and, of course, susceptibility to coercion and murder.

So then, does the decision for Dobbs hold up to the same scrutiny?

* Would revoking the Right erode the establishment of general safety of any US citizens? Yes, it hinders economic opportunity, creates an environment that fosters harassment by other citizens and agents of the law, threatens physical safety due both to medical risks and rates of homicide, and furthermore revokes the Right of Privacy even for US citizens beyond the subgroup of ""pregnant women"".
* Would maintaining the Right erode the establishment of general safety of any US citizens? No, because the 14th amendment only classifies a US citizen as someone *born* in the US.

I find it strange that people claiming the Constitution to be this infallible, conservative, never-changing doctrine are pushing for dissenters to ""just amend the Constitution if you think abortion should be a Right"". I would argue the Right to abortion is not broad enough to risk the integrity of the foundation of our government and should remain a new Right as established by SC precedent. I would say Roe should be upheld until such time as the unborn are deemed US citizens. So, really, it should be pro-lifers that should ""just amend the Constitution"".

In the Republic system, laws are made by the elected representatives of the people. In a democracy, the will of the majority has the right to override the existing rights.

Additionally, the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

The founders did not trust a strong federal government, as they felt it would lead to a corrupt executive. And they just went through  a seven-year revolution to overthrow just that. I know you said don’t use the 10th Amendment, but that’s like saying tell me why it’s good to breathe oxygen but don’t talk about lungs. 

There are some issues to which it makes sense for states to have power. For example, minimum wage laws. How well does the legislature in DC understand how the cost of living is in Omaha, San Diego, Anchorage, or Buffalo?

I don’t think anything I have to say will change your view, but military service was the worst decision I made other than meeting my wife while in. I wasn’t in a combat role or anything but it fucked me up pretty good for life. I was labeled a malingerer and shitbag by my chief’s quarters near the end (honorable discharge) when I sought mental help for the extraordinary stress of my job and transition out. Got unofficially DRB’d for requesting medication after several months of therapy still left me depressed and anxious to the point where I was having significant trouble focusing at work.

Since being labeled as such I lost all the people who I thought were my buddies. Can’t hold down a job for shit now, I had a really good one that paid 6 figures for 2 years but I had to quit because I couldn’t handle it, pretty sure the whole experience triggered some sort of latent bipolar. I have constant thoughts of suicide and worthlessness, bouts of anger, frequently can’t get out of bed. Worst part is no friends or family to talk to about it. Have my first appt with the VA next week and will be asking to see someone for mental health ASAP.

Anyway I know I’m just bitching about my laziness here, the military does provide great training, career opportunities, resume building, life experience etc. But it takes a special breed of person as well and can have tremendously negative effects on some (many nowadays, there are an absolutely unreasonable number of suicides on active duty navy alone).

- I'm not by any means an expert on rap but for my personal preference the rap that came after straight outta Compton was more enjoyable for me though I cannot deny that it's a good album.

- The rolling stones was at their best in the 60's and 70's.

- Solid album by hall and oats, 80 is an either or kind of year yet I cannot deny I enjoy hall and oats
As a fan of slash I think what he has come to do with velvet revolver and SLASH now is far superior to his time with gnr, I used to enjoy them so I can admit that the album has appeal and was tapped into something influential at the time, I just thing it wouldn't be considered superior to gnr's rock predecessors nor those who came after.

-I'll admit that I forgot about Metal, 80's had some fantastic metal come out of it and if someone can let me know how I'll even give you a little !delta for it cause some sick metal came from the 80's

- I prefer hunkey dory and ziggy stardust to any of bowies 80s albums. I just feel like even though he was changing with the times something was missing in those albums.

- Elton John is a GOAT you got me there too

- Billy Joel I know his hits but ill have to dive deeper and see if my prejudices hold true for his 80's stuff. It seems I doubt they will so maybe you got me again.

That’s still abuse. Amber is not his doctor. She has no say in when he should be taking his medication. And depriving Depp of his medication when he is in pain is a monstrous act. That under no circumstances should be tolerated.

There is evidence that both Depp and Heard were violent. The issue is who was the primary aggressor. And the overwhelming majority of the evidence is Amber was the aggressor. You are willing to acknowledge that victims of abuse sometimes act in retaliation. I already know that. I have family members that were victims of abuse and sometimes would retaliate against their aggressor. No one is saying victims of abuse should never act in self defense.

The problem is you are only willing to acknowledge self defense when its a woman being violent. Amber Heard chopped of Depp’s finger. And your mad that he wrote on the walls with his blood. Amber Heard admitted to throwing pots, pans and vases at Depp and chased him when he fled in terror. And your mad he left the room during an argument. Amber Heard deprived Depp of medication needed to treat his withdrawal symptoms to the point it caused him immense suffering. And your mad that he didn’t smile and say thank you. It doesn’t matter to you how violent and cruel Heard was to Depp. The fact that Depp didn’t respond to Heard’s violence with gratitude and compliance makes him an abuser in your eyes.

&gt;From a legal standpoint, the issue the experts needed to address is did the images come from the correct time and have they been modified using a program like Photoshop.

Hilarious the photo’s were obviously manipulated and your going to pretend they weren’t. Look at the photo’s in this video.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7gqR17zN88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7gqR17zN88)

It’s the same photo but the lighting and saturation have been manipulated. If the edited image was from the same day as the others. That just means she edited it the same day. It only takes a few minutes to edit a photo’s lighting and saturation.

&gt;Ms. Heard's expert was able to show that all images which were selected by Mr. Depp's expert as modified, were found with the expected meta data on devices. Those images were visually identical even though the meta data was different.

You didn’t watch the trial. The images she gave were back ups of back ups. In order to verify the date they would need the original phone not just back ups exported to another device. Anyone can edit a back up image to say what they want. Without the corresponding data on the original phone the images she provided tell us nothing about their authenticity.

The best and most sensible argument here is that gun control isn't monolithic and there are gun control measures large numbers of gun owners support.

You can support a broad right to the ownership of guns while pushing for more controls for who gets access to which guns.

My favorite recent interpretation is why not treat guns rights like driving or pilot licenses? 

You get to operate tiny guns, vehicles, etc... but that depends on age and experience and passing a serious level of testing.

You can let nearly anyone operate a dirt bike, but an 18 wheeler should need more training and certification.

Kings and aristocrats are the system of the last couple of thousand years. They had nothing to do with our evolution. They came because some people were able to use force on people. And the reason we trashed them is that we thought they were unfair. Our innate moral compass (the one build by the evolution) thinks that it is unfair that someone would have a lot more resources of the society just because they are lucky at birth (note, this is the same thing I'll come back later).

Or are you really of the view that your or other people that you know feeling of fairness disagrees with the one that starts the US declaration of independence (appropriate time bring that up)?

&gt;Right but our argument is really about the best method to get material welfare for people.

No it's not. At least to me that is not ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is happy people. The material welfare is one of the tools towards to it, but as I talked about social capital, there are other elements as well. I'd add clean environment to it as well. And there are others as well.

&gt;These countries also have better Free Market ratings than America.

That's exactly my point. They are free in terms of running the economy. There is very low corruption. The barriers to start and run business are low. And rent-seeking is not very easy way to make money.

But at the same time they have very low [gini coeffiecient](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gini-coefficient-by-country). Finland is 27.4. UK is at 34.8 and the US at 41.1 (I am looking at CIA numbers).

As I said they've found the sweet spot where you take advantage of the free market economy to push up the production, but then share the results of that high production more equally in the society than what a pure capitalist system would do. This is the key why they top the happiness rankings (which at least to me is the one that matters, not just material stuff) and the countries with higher total income don't do as well when it comes to keeping people happy.

I'm really curious to know why you think the total amount of stuff is important and not happiness. If you think of your own life, would you really have more income or more happiness?

&gt;Finally we disagree here as well. You should get paid for your talent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Because...and this is important. The economy is not a zero sum game. When you produce or help produce a good or a service. You're not taking away from anyone.

I didn't see any moral argument there. I think this comes to the fundamental disagreement between us on how we see people. I see people as part of the society. If you cast me out of the society, my talent would be absolutely worthless. I would not be able to keep myself alive. I need the society around me. That's why it is fair to me that I only get a fair share of the value of my work not all of it. Again, I go back to that hunter-gatherer tribe. I could be the successful hunter there. But without the rest of the tribe, I would have nothing. I would die very quickly. That's why it is fair that I share part of my success that's based on pure luck. This comes to the top. If you're against me having to share the results of my talent that I have by pure luck, then would you oppose a social system based on monarchy and aristocracy, where your income is based on where you happened to be born? If not, what's the difference?

The only thing that matters to me, is that I have incentives to work. So, if I would get the same income without doing any work and doing the work that markets currently value relatively well, then sure, I'd probably not work and spent my to time doing something different that I personally value more than working. But getting over border is not very hard. I'm already doing way more meaningful and fulfilling work than a janitor. And have a lot more control over my work as well. On top of that I'm also being paid more. I don't see it wrong that some of that income that I get as gross income (the value the market is willing to pay for my work) is spread more evenly.

&gt;You don't build a thriving economy like that. I'm sorry you just don't. You can't pander to the lowest denominator. It would be like the Chicago Bulls benching Michael Jordan so that some benchwarmer can play. If you're being competitive and your goal is to win. You can't do that.

This was the best example so far. Thanks for it. This illustrates my point the best. So, just like Bulls plays Jordan in the matches, Finland puts their highly trained engineers to make Nokia phones (ok, this example doesn't work as well as it did 20 years ago, but you get my point). The benchwarmer does his share. He trains just as much as Jordan during the week and when called, he goes to the court and does his best. And now comes the important point. When at the end of the season, they win the trophy, the entire team including Jordan and the benchwarmer are celebrating the victory equally. They both get the winner's medal. They both are champions. This is the key. We live in a team, not as hermits.

So, the same way the Finnish engineer pays his share of the taxes with a smile on his face ([80% of Finns are happy to pay their taxes, 96% think it is a civic duty](https://finland.fi/life-society/facts-and-feelings-do-taxes-make-finnish-people-happy)) and joins the janitor to live in a society that has produced the happiest people on the planet for at least 5 years in a row.

Finland has an employment rate of 72.2%, the US has it at 67.1% ([data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268127/employment-rate-in-selected-industrialized-countries/)) meaning that obviously the Finnish system has better incentives to make people to work to produce human welfare for the people than the American one.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

&gt;I have sat on the fence of this issue for a few years, but I have yet to find a true argument against opposing gun control from a moral standpoint. 

Let me start off by pointing out that morality doesn't really matter. 

This is a legal discussion. You cannot enforce your morals through law. 

&gt;Banning guns outright is hurting the people’s right to self defense specifically from the government.

No, it does not. Not in any simple sense. 

The right to self-defence isn't inherently tied to the right to bear arms. 

&gt;If they were to attempt tyranny, how can you fight back? 

It's adorable that you think civil guns can take on the military arsenal, if it actually does get to tyranny. 

But there's another point here: people often throw up a false dichotomy. That of the people Vs the (state controlled) military. 

Soldiers aren't mindless drones. Soldiers are people. Soldiers are citizens. 

&gt;Even for background checks, what’s stopping the checks to include barring people of particular political affiliations from owning firearms? 

Anti discrimination laws, which already exists.

Yes. That's what society is.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

&gt; some people can use bad faith tactics to win.

You keep talking about winners and losers. How do you determine that you've ""lost"" a debate? What is the criteria? Does a guy in a black and white striped shirt walk in an blow a whistle? Discourse isn't a sport. To approach it as one seems to me to be a perversion and debasement of discourse. I don't know the extent to which high schools treat their debate programs like sport (I haven't watched or participated, personally) and I can see the value of the format as a learning exercise, but I hope they're clear that what they're having students do is still a big departure from discourse.

Here's maybe a better heuristic to go by for whether you've ""won"" a conversation. If people who are highly educated in the subject, honest, operating in good faith, etc. think that you presented your case in a rigorous, fair, and accurate way, you've won. Note that your counterpart can also have won if they've achieved the same. And note that you've still won even if you've convinced no one. If you're operating in bad faith, using underhanded rhetorical tactics that you would hypocritically object to if they were used on you, trying to win points with gotchas, deploying obvious logical fallacies, etc. you've lost. Note that your counterpart can also have lost if they've done the same. And note that they've still lost even if they've convinced everyone.

You'll probably call this idealistic, but I'd call it the only thing deserving of being called discourse. If you're in it to ""win"" rather than to have accumulated and expressed deep understanding of something, then I'd say you're more concerned about power than about truth. That's not discourse. That's combat. If what you want to play at is combat, that's fine, just know that it's a different kind of activity. Politics is rarely ever discourse; politics is combat in a poorly-made discourse costume. We need to always make room in the world for pure discourse to also exist, because there will never be any shortage of combat. Discourse doesn't need to be ""fixed"" by lowering it into the mud. You're correct that in combat you're lucky if there are any rules of engagement at all. Agreeing to rules and then breaking them is just another valid tool in the toolbox where combat is concerned, because combat is about power.

I take it that you value discourse and want to be involved in discourse, but other people are dragging you into combat.

 &gt;No your point is contradictory as anarchists don't believe in any sort of centralized authority.

I'm not joking. This has been happening for years and years to users on /r/asktransgender and *especially* /r/mtf.

We have, every single day, like a dozen terrified people who tentatively post threads on those subreddit because they're suspecting they might be transgender.

Many of them are facing being disowned by their entire families and divorced by their spouses. They're *terrified*.

Yes, those users could just log out to see. Turns out the overwhelming majority of people are lazy, and won't take that extra step.

Although the studies I shared weren't trying to answer that question and I didn't share them to speak to de-transitioning, there are other pieces of research that do.

[A survey of 27k individuals in the US](https://fenwayhealth.org/new-study-shows-discrimination-stigma-and-family-pressure-drive-detransition-among-transgender-people/) found that about 13% had de-transitioned at some point. So, no, it's not a negligible amount. However, you're making the assumption that they de-transition because they just whoopsie-changed-my-mind, and that's not supported with evidence. Out of those who had de-transitioned...

&gt;&gt;The most common reason cited for detransition was pressure from a parent (35.5%), pressure from their community or societal stigma (32.5%), or trouble finding a job (26.8%). Other reasons included pressure from medical health professionals (5.6%) or religious leaders (5.3%) [...]Only 2.4% of transgender people who reported past detransition attributed this to doubt about their gender identity, while only 10.4% attributed their past detransition to fluctuations in gender identity or desire.

[This study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9570489/) found the most common reason for de-transitioning was that a person suffered loss of community and family due to transphobia. While there are certainly people who de-transition and it's not a *negligible* amount, the assumption that de-transitions happen because someone changed their mind about their identity is a very small portion of them. 

It may seem like a reasonable and well-intended concern to wonder about the authenticity of a teenager's gender transition, but in reality, you are grasping at anything to invalidate trans identities. The study methodology isn’t good enough because they must feel shame and not report. The doctors aren’t going to be able to know who really needs help. David Bowie said he was bi once like that has fuck all to do with a transitioning a whole ass gender? Do you honestly, sincerely think that teens are doing it because it's trendy? That they’re seeking medical care, taking hormones, making a publicly obvious physical transition and altering the way literally every person they know sees them…because the cool kids are doing it? Because the world is so kind and celebrating of trans people? Come on, man. That’s dumb.

No you can't. Because any system with a working judicial system (even a bad one) would rule against discrimination. This is why all gun control laws don't carve out bans for specific groups only specific weapons or behaviors.  AKA no fully auotmatic rifles and no guns for people who beat their spouses.

Anarchists don't believe in a government. Without a government it is up to whoever can amass the most power and influence. And history has shown time and time again that the violent and ambitious are the ones to achieve that.  Anarchist live in the same fantasy world that Libertarians live in. The difference is that Libertarians think businesses/corporations are some how all benevolent caring organizations that totally wouldn't sell a worker into slavery to make a quick buck, anarchists apply the same logic to every day people. And it is just as naive and willfully ignoring all of human history as Libertarians do.

I agree the images displayed are slightly different.  It is 100% possible that Ms. Heard imported the photos into Photos 3.0 and adjusted the color.  It's her computer and it's 100% reasonable to adjust an image once it is imported.  Having multiple copies of an image, having images that have been cropped, resized, lightened, darkened, etc.  That is all normal things people do with photos on their computer. Do you ever use you computer to adjust photos?  Are you planning on having your computer become part of a trial?   Could you remember and explain every photo you ever adjusted?  That is what you are asking Ms. Heard to do.

So, it is not amazing that an image imported into Photos 3.0 might have been enhanced.  In fact, it's super easy to do 

From Apple web forum post:
&gt; Photos in High Sierra OSX now allows for auto enhancing multiple images at once - just select them, and hit Command-E.

If the image from Photos 3.0 was the only copy of the image and there was not iPhone original that would be a different problem, but that wasn't the case.  

I've mentioned this before [Why your iPhone camera takes better pictures than your DSLR](https://www.photographyacademy.com/why-phones-take-better-pictures-than-your-dslr/)

What this article goes into detail about is all of the image adjustments the iPhone camera hardware and software do automatically when you take a picture.  So, technically, the iPhone doesn't give you the bits just as they were coming out of the image sensor, it gives you an exposure adjusted, color adjusted, stabilized image.  iPhones are not scientific instruments and can't be used to make precise measurements.  So, trying to use any iPhone image as an accurate representation of the image your eye would see is not possible.  That's not what the camera's are designed to do.  

That's just on the capture side of the problem.  The display side has all the same issues as the capture.  Is the brightness set higher on one monitor vs. another.  Is the color setting the same.  On down the list.  None of these display related variables were discussed in the courtroom.  Most people don't even pay attention to display variations.  But people who work with digital images (like Mr. Depp's expert) should be aware of these issues and should have provided calibration data for all the equipment he used if he was going to suggest there was a scientific difference between these images.  He didn't so all I or anyone else can say is that he displayed two images that looked the same in terms of photographic detail, but which were different when displayed.  

The monitors the jury viewed the images on.  Same set of problems.  Monitor and lighting variations in the room can change how the human eye perceives images on a computer screen. 

So, my claim is that as long as the image hasn't been modified to add or remove information that was in the original via a tool like Photoshop, we can agree that the images are essentially the same.  Unless we control all of the variables affecting what our eyeballs see we have to accept the variations that exists when using real cameras and real displays.  

This should not be a controversial point.

Now back to having a Photos 3.0 and iPhone image which ""look"" different.  As I said, once the image is imported into Photos 3.0 it is 100% reasonable that the image would be adjusted.  And because we just agreed that all of the capture and display variables which are not being measured or controlled can have as big an impact on what our eyeballs see as the image adjustment done in Photos 3.0 their is no practical difference between the two images.  It just boils down to aesthetics.

AND, because the actual original image was found on an iPhone and the images only show aesthetics differences, there is no evidence of image tampering.  

I know that is a lot to take in, but the courtroom is not a laboratory and applying scientific standards to courtroom evidence which generally wouldn't benefit from that level of accuracy means the court uses commercial grade equipment and lives with the imperfections that result.

Also, if you look at the video you linked, the iPhone version of the image appears to have slightly higher brightness but similar color saturation as the the Photos 3.0 image.  Otherwise the images are pretty much identical in term of image details.

One final thing to look at is if you have the same video playing in two separate browser windows on your screen at the same time you can pause the video in one browser at 0:36 (Photos 3.0 image) and in the other browser at 1:28 (Defense exhibit which is being discussed).  If you do this there is pretty noticeable difference between these two images which Mr. Depp's expert just said should be identical.  Why is that the case?  I can't tell you.  That's just variability in something that is not accounted for by Mr. Depp's expert (or anyone else).  But, this should convince you that there are too many uncontrolled variables that impact the image being seen by the human eyeball to make scientific arguments about these images.  

I did all the work so you can just take a look at [Comparison of Photos 3.0 image to Defense Exhibit](https://ibb.co/fX0t5gC)

[Here are all three images from the video you linked displayed in three web browser windows at the same time](https://ibb.co/Y7GMGCP)



&gt; You didn’t watch the trial. The images she gave were back ups of back ups. In order to verify the date they would need the original phone not just back ups exported to another device. Anyone can edit a back up image to say what they want. Without the corresponding data on the original phone the images she provided tell us nothing about their authenticity.

Yes I did.

The judge ruled that Mr. Depp's expert could supervise ""in-person"" or over ""Zoom"" while Ms. Heard's experts performed the collection of artifacts requested by Mr. Depp.

This was a fair process.

Why would the judge do it this way? It's not an arbitrary decision. The short answer is that if one side holds the ""originals"" and it is their proof, you don't hand over physical possession of the ""originals"" to the side which might ""accidentally"" misplace them. You give them copies which have a verifiable chain of custody. This is just how it works.

The same thing happens with physical paper.

Keep in mind that civil cases are not investigated by the state. So, it is not like there was a raid on Mr. Depp's home(s) and all of his devices were seized. Same thing for Ms. Heard. If the court ordered an action and the party so ordered refused, that triggers some consequences that might require the state to step in.

I think that capitalism is a ""immoral"" system which ultimately works, making it somewhat moral. That said, ""capitalism"" is just a single word for many systems, and in itself doesn't ensure that the dangers (like corruption) are kept in check, and these dangers are real and failing to stop them will lead to some kind of unfortunate state where extreme change is required to fix it.

Anyway, what always happens must happen, e.g. that the bold take up the opportunities that the cowardly don't dare to, and that things which can be exploited will be exploited. It almost seems like a natural law, since it happens even when we try to keep it in check, so how could it be unnatural? And why bring morality into the picture at all? That a system ""works"" seems to me to require that it's not too immoral, as things which offend our tastes will ultimately get challenged by us. There's also the thing that most unfortunate states are a result of systems which doesn't work.

This is the best we can currently do, it's still far from perfect, but people simply don't understand how the world works to fix anything, and by bringing morality into the picture they're simply making it harder for themselves. That the rich get richer and prevent competition is an obvious consequence. Even if smaller players can compete, they have to piggyback off the bigger ones and share their surplus (e.g. if I make a game and release it, I have to rely on Steam or an App store). The amount of everything is decreasing and merging into huge singular structures which can't be challenged and which will slowly rot and collapse under themselves as everything without competition is bound to do. 

Why does it matter if capitalism is compatible with Christianity? They'll probaly collide on a subset of ideas and influence the other proportionally to their strengths, and even if we understood this perfectly well, could we do anything more than just watch it happen?

If you want to discuss bigger dangers, it's the politicalization of everything and the propaganda that it brings with it. This has caused people (mostly the left) to fight against their own interests. Is this the point you're making? The left is all for tyranny, for nothing but tyranny can give them the power required to eradicate that which they deem immoral and evil, but the tyranny that they're giving power is merely pretending to care, and it's no less evil than the structures which they're fighting against.

We had safe-guards in place to prevent situations like these, which were rules which has a higher sphere than both sides, e.g. absolute values like ""you shall not kill"" which ensure that both sides are safe. In order to promote itself even higher, the left started opposing human rights, with the argumentation that ""bad people"" did not deserve to be treated as human, and that rights were earned rather than inherent. And so we've regressed 100s of years in terms of systems, for even if ""the good guys"" are in charge, we've gone back to the belief that the biggest group of people is right and that the exception is evil, which is the system in which bullying and harassment of that which stands out is natural. So what if sexuality and race are not primary areas of harassment anymore? There's an infinite amount of dimensions across which one can discriminate, and discriminate is completely inherent to life, and any fairness must be forced through mutual agreements bounded in objectivity rather than subjectivity, and that's what the law and human rights were before politics infected them.

BMI is generally a useful indicator for 99% of people because they're not generally particularly muscley. Body fat percentage is a more useful metric in most of the outlying cases.

It's silly to think that a medical professional would look at a bodybuilder, see that their BMI is high and conclude that they are therefore overweight/fat. Similarly if someone has a low BMI but a high bodyfat percentage they still wouldn't say ""oh well your BMI is fine so I guess you're not overweight"".

Being an unhealthy weight is medically determinable and as such it is an objective fact. If you think someone is overweight but medically they are not, as I have already said, it is not just opinion, you are wrong.

Edit: in addition... If he's 6ft and 200lb that would give him a BMI of ~27kg/m^2. A healthy weight is generally considered to be between 18 and 24 so...

I mostly don't disagree with you. Some men do fear being raped, but not like women fear it (en mass).

There is a huge shortage of real feminists because very few feminists will acknowledge these things. 

&gt; you being 6 foot also already provides you with an advantage of others avoiding you/you can see more/fight easier.

This can be true, but it's not a rule. Plenty of men and women being physically abused or raped could have been capable of overpowering their attacker, but couldn't for other reasons. For example, if a woman tries to rape a man and he punches her in the eye, who is the police officer *really* going to believe when she has a black eye but he doesn't? Even if he did, still, the point can be just as valid. 

&gt; and if you tell a police officer that “oh, this and this happened,” they’ll be like “oh, ok.” but if a women were to do that, you’ll get the “but what were you wearing? why where you even out so late?”

What I wrote above applies to this point as well. This does happen, but switch the genders, and the man will be told he wasn't raped, he should've fought back, ""you can't be raped, she's a girl"". My problem with this point you made here is you can't use this as a ""blanket statement"" if you know what I mean. Like this isn't a rule, or automatically the experience the female victim might have.

She is growing a life within her body, she *wants* to do that, and she hopes it survives. There's a chain of continuity between the first ultrasound and the eventual child graduating college - it's all part of their story.

If a woman becomes pregnant and doesn't want it, the fetus is nothing to her. She doesn't dream about her future child because she doesn't want a child. But no one else can have *that* baby.

&gt;If vaccines reduce viral density in those who do become infected despite vaccination, it would probably lead to lower infectiousness and less onward transmission. Hence, the authors compared the viral kinetics in breakthrough delta variant infections in vaccinated people with delta variant infections in unvaccinated people. They report that peak viral loads showed a faster decline in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated people, although peak viral loads were similar for unvaccinated and vaccinated people.  
&gt;  
&gt;This study confirms that COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of delta variant infection and also accelerates viral clearance in the context of the delta variant. However, this study unfortunately also highlights that the vaccine effect on reducing transmission is minimal in the context of delta variant circulation. These findings have immediate public health implications. Higher vaccination coverage rates need to be achieved because indirect protection from vaccinated to unvaccinated people remains suboptimal.

&amp;#x200B;

It matters to the person you pass covid onto. It you are contagious for 7 days unvaccinated but only 4 vaccinated then it has a noticeable impact on the spread of it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;​ Turns out the first vaccine had no further impact, the second one seemed to be useless since we needed a third, then the boosters came and well… these are all signs to me that many governments had no idea what the hell they were getting themselves into.

&gt;I cannot get my head around why half of the world has given in to taking such a new and understudied “vaccine”. And yes, I do know that mRNA vaccines have been patented since 2017 and that they have probably been developing and studying them for perhaps 10-15 years; but never in the history of humanity has such an alternative vaccine been so widely accepted and massively injected until COVID came

According to [WHO](https://covid19.who.int/), the number of cumulative deaths from Covid or Covid-related illnesses equals about **6,3** **million people**. That is more than the entire population of Denmark, for example. Is it really that surprising that the world scrambled to find a vaccine for one of the most contagious diseases in the last century?

&gt;I, for one, am a 20 year old healthy student. I do not smoke nor do I do any drugs and I drink occasionally exclusively at parties. I have had COVID a whopping 4 times and have never had any worse symptoms than the ones I’ve heard the vaccine potentially gives you.

Anegdotal evidence is not evidence. Just because you went through all 4 sick periods without a scratch does NOT mean you were not at risk; The biggest problem with Covid is not the sickness itself, but possible complications, like lung diseases; even a healthy person could have future problems.

&gt;When I first began to wonder whether or not I should take the vaccine, I looked into its ingredients and found out about the contents of not only graphene but also tromethamine and luciferase.

Scary-sounding medical names do not automatically mean that something is poisonous or dangerous; that's one. Two, just because something has a well-known and widespread use (e.g. Graphene is used in production of various high-tech devices of modern age, like solar cells or mobile phones), does not mean that it's always going to be dangerous to a human. One of my favourite examples is salt - NaCl. Sodium (Na) is highly reactive, used as anti-icing and in preservatives; it is also used as an alloying metal. Chlorine (Cl) was used as a main ingredient of poisonous gasses during World War I. My point being - just because the vaccine has various chemical compounds does NOT mean it's dangerous.

&gt;Turns out the first vaccine had no further impact, the second one seemed to be useless since we needed a third, then the boosters came and well… these are all signs to me that many governments had no idea what the hell they were getting themselves into.

Of course many governments had no idea what they were getting themselves into - Covid was a pandemic, and they were trying to find the solution as quickly as possible to avoid further lockdowns and economic crashes. On that note, [according to WHO again](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines?adgroupsurvey={adgroupsurvey}&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw2f-VBhAsEiwAO4lNeDRAhmEm5NZJsDGFcwesBkqjrxXez346oLYQYSSdWCcR77xjX_kCpBoCuQYQAvD_BwE), the vacciness reduce the risk of suffering serious consequences of Covid, as well as that of transmitting Covid to others if you happen to get infected. Vaccinating essentially prevents the illness from being spread further, or at least highly reduces the risk of it happening. The fact that there were second and third shots is basically an effect of the virus mutating quickly.

&gt;Covid vaccines have grown to be a billion dollar industry yet every 4 months or so we are given a new vaccine because the earlier ones did not help cure this “cold”.

I haven't seen any ""new"" vaccines since 2021 - just modernised, newer version of the old ones, which is - again - caused by high mutation factor of Covid.

&gt;And to top it all off, vaccinated people still do get COVID at the same degree as 99.9% of un-vaccinated(excluding the very rare potential death).

I'd like to see where you got these statistics from, because they look like they've been pulled out of your ass.

&gt;Vaccinated people also still have to take tests to fly and still need to wear masks in public transport.

&gt;&gt;Divorce does the same as well and that’s allowed. 

So while I find a lot of your view problematic, I'm just going to challenge this specific aspect of your view.

Do you think that divorce and incest have the same potentially disruptive effects on family dynamics?  Yes, obviously divorce is something that is relatively normalized, or at least much less stigmatized than it used to be, despite being highly disruptive, but it's more of a formal disruption of overt relationships. You are saying ""our family is going to be different because the parents are no longer going to be married, and here are the effects of that"".

With incest, changes in family dynamics are often subtler and are about violations of boundaries, trust, and taboos. I'm sure there is probably the rare hypothetical incestuous relationship between first cousins who are totally consenting and have no overly problematic dynamics, But those circumstances are far outweighed by the damage that an incestuous relationship with poor boundaries and potential exploitation can do.

No, admittedly, my view on this might be a little biased because I used to work in a psych ward with adolescence, and a lot of them reported abuse by family members including cousins or other extended family of the same or opposite sex. I can even think of one particular case where my girl was molested by her cousin after initially experiencing attraction to him, But didn't want to proceed because she didn't know how to navigate the boundary between their existing relationship and a sexual one.

Second, even if we accept this as true, that is still 500,000 people in the United States alone dying of covid directly.  Is that not enough to be considered a high death toll? Because that's more than die of basically any other contagious disease in recent memory.

If someone has a stroke because COVID caused them to throw a blood clot, they still died because COVID exacerbated existing health factors that would not have killed them without COVID. Thus, COVID is still the cause of death.

I don't think the number is that small - in principle any team sport should work, no? You could tweak the rules a bit; for example, hockey could be 4 * 15 minutes instead of 3 * 20. Soccer could have quarters of 20 or 25 minutes instead of 45-minute halves. Relays in running or swimming could alternate. You could have multi-sport competitions, similar to the Olympics, where countries compete *as countries* and not as individual athletes, so for example a country's score in the 100m dash is the sum of that country's man's time and woman's time.

The principle here is to adapt sports so they require both men and women to participate and each of these genders is equally important to the end result.

&gt; Would you merge existing leagues or create new leagues?

If I could wave a magic wand, I would merge them - assuming I would still think this is a good idea - but I know that is not feasible, so it would have to be new ones. I know this would still be very hard to put into practice, but I still want to know if my idea is, apart from being hard to implement, a good idea.

&gt; How would it work with financing as wouldn't each team have double the number of players and possibly ancillary staff?

I think the ancillary staff numbers rise by less than a factor of two, but I know that's not the core of your question. To speak to that core, I think that, while costs would increase, revenue could also increase - I think women's interest in sports would increase in this scheme.

And let's be honest - there is already a sh\*tload of money in sports; I am not sure Steph Curry would be that sad about making $40 million instead of $45. (I don't think pay would be absolutely equal between genders, but I do think it would be *less unequal* than it currently is.) From an economic viewpoint, these star players have paradoxically little leverage; sure they can command these astronomical sums when negotiating between playing for team A or team B, and they also have all the advertising deals (which would change very little in my idea), but how much money could Curry make *outside* of pro basketball? So, if that magic wand was available, I would integrate the leagues and most male athletes would still participate, even for less money.

&gt; I don't agree with the forcing men to play the first and 3rd quarters, why not coin flip who goes first? Instead of manipulating the experiment to force your outcome?

If we lived in a world where men's and women's separate leagues had the same amount of media coverage and attendance and revenue and player ""stardom"", then yes, your suggestion would fit with my idea. (I might not even propose my idea in that hypothetical world, in any case.)

But that is not the world we live in; the world we live in gives wayyyyyyyy more attention, and money, to men's sports. The basis of the idea is to treat this as an issue that needs to be addressed, and that basis is not the focus that is potentially subject to deltas.

In other words, I am not asking here whether gender inequality is a problem - that might be another post, but I am sure it has been discussed in this subreddit. I am asking: *assuming* it is a problem, is this idea something that contributes to a solution?

Given this context, I do believe having men start the game and women finish would more effectively convey the message that both are equally important to the final result. If women play the first quarter, many men would treat that as the opening band in a concert, which might be nice but it's not what you paid to see so it's okay to miss. And in close games, the bulk of the excitement often comes from the last moments (see [peak-end rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule)\), so having women play those promotes their importance.

However, after typing all this, I realize that maybe flipping a coin would be okay. During an initial transition period, it would probably be better to still tip the scales so that people get used to seeing the women's teams as equal contributors to the final result; but once that is well-established, then yes, maybe flipping a coin would be good, so here's a ∆. I don't know how that would impact coaches' strategy, for example, but I am sure people would just adapt to not knowing which gender-half of the team plays first.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

Take an example - if 2 unvaccinated people die, and 2 vaccinated people die, we could look at this and say, hey, the vaccine must be pretty useless. But if there are only 5 unvaccinated people in total, and 15 vaccinated people, then 2/5 unvaccinated died while only 2/15 vaccinated people did. That now becomes a pretty compelling argument to take the vaccine. In the article it details some of the real numbers in the US - 1.71 unvaccinated deaths per 100k people, vs. .22 vaccinated ones. That means the unvaccinated are over seven times more likely to die than the vaccinated. Does this mean I'm signing my own death sentence if I don't vaccinate? No. But if the vaccine is harmless, as you've said, why the hell wouldn't I want to be seven times less likely to die of COVID?

If you like, you can check out the stats for [Washington state](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/421-010-CasesInNotFullyVaccinated.pdf), directly from their Department of Health - the unvaccinated are more likely to get COVID, more likely to be hospitalized from it, and more likely to die from it, at every age group.

As for the men... I totally hear your point. Yes, it would be less interesting for them in terms of the enjoyment of playing the game. My thought here is a reframing of what a game of basketball (or any other sport) *is*, what the point of playing is. I want to reframe it so that sports reflect the fact that we, as humans, are divided 50-50 into two groups with distinct physical constitutions, and our games ought to represent both groups equally.

And surely the concept of sitting on the sidelines for a good part of the game hoping the rest of the team does their job well is not at all a weird concept in sports - it already happens in football and baseball!

It seems to me that if you really think a competitive athlete sitting on the sidelines for halt the game is unacceptable, then you should support changing football so that substitutions are tightly controlled like in soccer, so that in rough terms the same 11 guys are on the field the whole time, no matter which team has possession. Kinda like the amateur game. I don't even know how you would reform baseball, except maybe for prohibiting relief pitchers and requiring the starter to finish the game unless he's injured?

Nope, because 1: That’s a substantial power imbalance that can never be closed as in the case of two close in age siblings or cousins.

I don't think anyone has any delusions about the level of play being the same for both genders. Of course it is ridiculous when random dudes say they could win a match (or even a game) of tennis against Serena Williams; but I believe she would be nowhere near as dominant if she played against the professional male players. She'd certainly win some matches, but I doubt she could even reach a final. And I am talking about the very best woman to play tennis (I think, I don't follow tennis that closely).

But, as I mentioned on another comment: my thought here is a reframing of what a game *is*, what the point of playing is. I want to reframe it so that sports reflect the fact that we, as humans, are divided 50-50 into two groups with distinct physical constitutions, and our games ought to represent both groups equally. This already happens with mixed doubles in tennis! And I don't think anyone stigmatizes women in a mixed double because, I don't know, their serve is not as strong as the man's. We can just acknowledge this fact about our species and still give both groups equal importance, in all sports.

&gt; Viewership I don't think would be helped either. Per what I know of competitive video game leagues, people just do other stuff while the less competitive teams play. Likewise I think those who don't like women's sports would simply turn off or leave once the men are done.

The last sentence is why I would have women play the final part of the game - would you leave a stadium/arena before the fourth quarter? Without knowing whether you team won or lost? I don't think most people would!

&gt; No. You'd just have to invest enough in one to be dominant enough that the loss from the other wouldn't matter.

I don't think this would work as a strategy. Do you think any team could ever succeed while systematically getting thrashed during half of every game, and facing at least a competent opposition in the other half?",,changemyview,7,2022,1

The truth is that corporations are set up to only care about maximizing their profit. They are ALL ""money-grabbers"" by design, and if they find a way that lets them make more money at the expense of frustrating the customer, they will take that. 

 If 10 million people will buy a big name product that had a massive marketing budget, and then they will grumble about how buggy it was, then buy the next one (because that's what's marketing they et a chance to hear more about) and 1 million people buy a lovingly crafted experience and rave about it in indie niche communities, then big publishers will keep doing the latter, and they might get away with it in perpetuity.

How often does this apply to first degree relatives? Inbreeding only happens on a significant level when it comes to extended kin, or at most half-siblings. While yes it’s still bad and technically inbreeding, I’m not sure if it’s genetically damaging enough for the Westernmarck Effect to signal up a “red flag” so to say.

&gt; That's not how anything works, there is no reproductive sex drive that is distinctly driven by a consciously designed intent to cause pregnancies, that is fundamentally different from the general sexual pleasure that people are having when they are having gay sex, or for that matter just protected sex, anal sex, oral sex, etc.

Yes there is, that’s what all heterosexuality from a two-sex, sexually dimorphic species is based on. We reproduce via genetic diversity rather than asexually through cloning and if we weren’t supposed to be wired with that inherent reproductive drive then we wouldn’t be straight.

The only reason sex feels so good is because evolution evolved that way so that we’d do as much baby-making as possible, sex feeling good and the desire for sex is still technically based on a reproductive imperative.

Ever heard about the French Revolution, the American civil war, or ever heard about countries like north Korea, 9r some African countries, etc, etc, etc. Did you follow any of the semi recent conflicts in Turkey or Egypt?

It's not about the individual fighting the government, but the populace having the option to do so with enough firepower.

A government should never be able to win a war against 50% of its population, that should be a clear loss. And then I mean 50% of those capable of fighting, for simplicity sake, healthy (no disabilities), 18-55ish, and male (not saying women can't fight, just saying on average relatively few women shoot a gun in comparison to men, this is to get a good estimate and the men that didn't hold a gun will be compensated for by the women whom did). 

That option should always be there or you have a government that's too powerful, hell most already are too powerful considering how good many are at hiding things from their populace and manipulating (social) media to fit their narratives. That's more nefarious, although a more indirect and softer power, and unfortunately much harder to notice and fight, since the whole point is to make people believe it.

People have now partially been able to see and observe how Russia does so, and is probably one of the worst at it in most of the world. If you believe yours doesn't do similar things, albeit at smaller scales and for different topics, then I urge you to take a much harder and better look, obviously not using government aligned sources.

Maybe use alternative search engines, duckduckgo, yandex, bing, yahoo, etools.ch and maybe startpage, and then Google again, especially if you're from the EU or US, try yandex, etools, and duckduckgo instead of Google. In the early 2000s little to nothing was ever censored and search results weren't artificially skewed, nowadays that's much more the case. 

Point being it's the option to defend yourself from your government as a collective of individuals. 

What's legally allowed doesn't matter shit, as it's precisely that body which makes those laws that doesn't want to see itself overthrown ...

Yes, it would be less interesting for them in terms of the enjoyment of playing the game. My thought here is a reframing of what a game of basketball (or any other sport) is, what the point of playing is. I want to reframe it so that sports reflect the fact that we, as humans, are divided 50-50 into two groups with distinct physical constitutions, and our games ought to represent both groups equally.

That’s not really the point of professional sports though. The point of having professional leagues that represent the highest level of competition is to showcase the best that sport has to offer. The draw is the peak level athletics and performance of the sport. Sports have always been about trying to be the best, not represent the population. If you want to create a new league that does what you want, go for it. But I think you’d find elite athletes don’t want to play in it, nor do people want to watch it. 

&gt;And surely the concept of sitting on the sidelines for a good part of the game hoping the rest of the team does their job well is not at all a weird concept in sports - it already happens in football and baseball!

There’s a difference between players not playing because it’s not the optimal strategy vs players not playing so a second set of players can get there turn.

You'll find them regularily enough on twitter or reddit when discussing the athletic gap between men and women. But sure, most people know there's a difference, I'm more so talking about looking at it in a more direct comparison. When I watch xtreme sports (park, halfpipe) and see women or men directly after each other it is that much easier to see just the difference at play. I'm quite detail oriented, and since it becomes more clear to me, I don't think it's a stretch to imagine it will be more clear to others too.

&gt; would you leave a stadium/arena before the fourth quarter?

Yes, and have. I can get quite agitated when watching team sports.

&gt; I don't think most people would!

Sure, but I doubt it'd happen less than it already does. A major revenue stream is tv/streaming though.

&gt; I don't think this would work as a strategy.

There are teams focused around key players, it's quite common. Stack the field with good enough players and then get one or two who really excel. The point of the strategy would be to really hammer home a victory in the first half and let good-enough defensive players hold off in the second half. There's no doubt it would be a strategy, how successful and prevelant would depend on many factors.

&gt; Do you think any team could ever succeed while systematically getting thrashed during half of every game

50% of the game would be at the highest level men can play it - which is also the highest level it can be played, period - and the other 50% would be played at the highest level women can play it. I disagree that that many people would stop wanting to watch sports because of that.

&gt; Most people believe that it’s the name in the front of the jersey that matters, not the back, which is to say it’s about the team being the best it can, it’s not important who the players are.

This is almost exactly how I would phrase an argument *for* my view. It is just that you are thinking of the level of play, and I am thinking of who will win games and titles. I want teams to need women to win games and titles.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

Some stereotypes are true but many are not.  I think stereotyping is one of the reasons to NOT mention race unless its absolutely pertinent.  Why would I picture an acoustic guitar when you say your jamaican friend is bringing his guitar?  Because I know of Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff, or Toots and the Maytals?  If I pictured an acoustic guitar because of that id be basically wrong.   The ska/reggae stuff is characterized by guitar strummed on the offbeat.  It can of course be played on an acoustic guitar but youll see standard electric guitars plenty of live vids of these bands.  TBH id assume he was bringing an acoustic guitar because its kind of a pain to bring an electric and your amp to a random party.   Or what if im just a flat out ignorant bigot and my thought process is ""jamaican - black guy - rapper"".  You never know what sort of stereotypes people have in their heads.

&amp;#x200B;

If you said my jamaican mate john is bringing his guitar I could stereotype him into aforementioned ska and reggae, but then when he gets there he starts playing Wonderwall and old green day songs because thats what he grew up listening to.  My stereotyping was wrong headed.  Innocent assumption perhaps but still very wrong.  Now if you said ""my mate john is bringing his guitar.  Hes of jamaican heritage and plays fantastic jamaican style music"", that would very clearly tell me what to expect, why his being jamaican is pertinent, and head off any assumptions on my part based on stereotype.

&amp;#x200B;

  Throwing back to my asian cook friend in my post, I could say come over for dinner, annie my asian friend is cooking!  You could assume youd be having some sort of asian meal. Maybe assume youd be having fried rice.  Turns out shes from vietnam and is making Pho.  Or shes doing texas BBQ because thats where she grew up and her dad loved making texas BBQ because he grew up there too.  So, saying my asian friend is cooking without the context of ""shes first gen immigrant and learned traditional vietnamese cooking from her parents"" has led us to all kinds of wrong stereotypes, where if i just said my friend is cooking, theres no assumption.  Youd probably just ask whats for dinner.

For example, the assumption the training staff wouldn't increase by a factor of two. It totally would and it makes me wonder if you know how much work a training staff does to keep professional athletes performing at the highest level. The only way it wouldn't increase by a factor of 2 is if you plan on firing half of the male athletes so that half of the female athletes could participate, which has its own host of issues. 

Another assumption is that revenue would only drop slightly due to an increase in woman's viewership. This assumes there would not be a huge drop in male viewership, which I think is highly likely. You are talking about altering the product so drastically that these sports would be entirely different in terms of entertainment. The nfl's entertainment factor is that it is some of the largest and fastest men playing a very violent game at a very high skill level. There are no women's football leagues so to introduce women to the sport, you would not only see a drop in size and speed but also a huge drop in skill. It would be 2 quarters of men who have been playing since they were 7 and 2 quarters of women who just started playing as adults. No one would want to watch that. 

The same goes with basketball. Men's and women's basketball are very different even though they are both the same sport. The men's game is fast paced, the players are more athletic, taller, and stronger. There's at most a dozen professional women who can dunk, whereas there's probably less than a dozen professional men who can't dunk. The product on the court is totally different. 

It is the same thing for baseball. Women play softball with a larger ball, pitching at a shorter distance, with slower speeds. A good pitcher in softball throws  a 70 mile fastball(and that's at the upper end of the speed range), whereas a good variety high-school baseball pitcher hits the upper 80s and lower 90s. The average pitcher in the MLB throws a 95 mile and hour fast ball. Once again, the product is totally different. 

It's the same thing in hockey. The men's game is faster paced, there is a ton of hitting, and there are fights. The women's game is slower, with barely any hitting, and almost no fighting. The record slapshot speed in the nwhl is 87 miles an hour, while the average slapshot speed in the NHL is 100 miles an hour. 

For brevities sake, I will end with soccer. Men's soccer is faster paced, has more contact, and the men are more skilled.  USA soccer is a special case because the average sports fan in the USA does not care for soccer unless it is the world cup. People generally like to see winners so the woman's team has become more popular due to the men's team being total ass on the world stage, and the women's team being damn good on the world stage. The situation changes when you look at worldwide and country specific viewership. More people worldwide watched the men's world cup than the women's. 3 billion people watched the men's world cup whereas the woman's cup topped out at 1.1 billion. That is because the product on the field is totally different.

In conclusion, men's and women's professional leagues produce entirely different products on the field, court, or rink. Combining the genders would result in a totally different tv product which would drastically alter the entertainment value of the sport. Because of this, it is unlikely that male viewership would stay the same or increase and it is more likely that male viewership would decrease precipitously. The tv product and entertainment value would drastically change from quarter to quarter and that does not make for good tv viewing.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

The entire problem with your argument is that primary school does teach you what to think about society and history and college offers the opportunity to look at those views critically and question them by taking courses that give perspectives that do not fit the normative granted by the primary education system.

In fact:

&gt;If your field of study is specifically designed to teach you new and creative ways to view yourself as oppressed and pushes a very specific and politically-biased view of the history of specific groups of people, excluding voices from within that group which do not subscribe to the narrative, I do not feel that field of study is valid nor should be offered at colleges and universities.

This is *all* primary school offers. I am going to assume you're not a minority because if you were you may be one to notice a massive lack of interest in your own historical story in primary schools. In places where the majority is White for instance there are very limited, very contrived views of non-white figures most of which are not truly fleshed out beyond how they interacted with White culture at the time. A lot of these characters are White-washed as well meaning that their narratives are generally turned into political tools for their own glory. The teaching of civil rights in most countries, esp. where the majority *lost* almost always centers around the majority ""coming to their senses"" rather than fierce and vehement resistance that still exists today.

So:

&gt;What value do these degrees bring to society, exactly? 

For minorities these give a basis by which to stand in the society that they live; it makes no sense for instance that minorities experience the prejudices that exist without context. Regarding sexual oppression for instance a girl will be oppressed in most societies from birth through all forms of cultural and sociological ideological standards but where in primary school will that be explained? Nowhere. And of the more obscure oppressions such as ableism who would ever know or care to know the struggles for rights for the blind? I am certain you cannot name any cases without looking them up as the primary school system does not even begin to touch such a thing.

So, in turn, these must be offered not because it's some form of self-victimization but because it gives context to the world that these people experience from birth.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

In your system the chief executive (Prime Minister) is elected by Members of Parliament from among their numbers. This is why a PM must first win their local constituency: they need to get elected to Parliament to be eligible to become PM.

In the US the chief executive (President) is elected completely separately from Congress. In fact, our Constitution bans an individual from serving in two branches of government at the same time. So when a sitting member of Congress gets elected President they actually have to resign from Congress before becoming President.

Whether the American or British system is better isn't the point I'm trying to address. It sounds to me from this post that OP doesn't fully understand the differences between the American and British systems. Requiring a potential Presidential candidate to win their local House seat before being eligible for the Presidency is pretty counter to how the whole system is structured. It would require a radical restructuring of the entire American political system, which isn't possible any time in the foreseeable future and, thus, a pretty pointless debate.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

“It would, then, be all too easy to draw the wrong inferences from Sokal Squared. The lesson is neither that all fields of academia should be mistrusted nor that the study of race, gender, or sexuality is unimportant. As Lindsay, Pluckrose, and Boghossian point out, their experiment would be far less worrisome if these fields of study didn’t have such great relevance.

But if we are to be serious about remedying discrimination, racism, and sexism, we can’t ignore the uncomfortable truth these hoaxers have revealed: Some academic emperors—the ones who supposedly have the most to say about these crucial topics—have no clothes.”

These topics, and the continued study of them, is very important for social growth.

The issue is that some of the published pieces were published without due diligence done with regard to fact checking the actual authors stance and scientific history within the subjects…

For example…

Concerns about how a man masturbating to thoughts of a specific woman are valid…like if he is hyper fixated on a specific coworker and is building a dangerous fantasy he may try to actually create, or is also sharing his preference to think of her while masturbating…because this would create harm.  Of course it’s more his actions OUTSIDE his thoughts that are the concern, and that is different from simply saying a single fantasy is sexual assault…

Understanding facts like how rape is something that occurs in the animal kingdom is important for understanding human socialization…but can’t include an expectation that human exclusive thoughts are actually occurring in the animals….

Ultimately the issue is that SOME people misuse this information, and difficulties different demographics face, as a way to further disrupt society….while most actually want to identify and repair the issues without creating huge divisions within society.

Like in my criminal justice class…we learned about stereotyping, profiling, racism, sentencing disparities, and generational poverty….but we also learned about how these are simultaneously next to actual crimes being committed…and reducing the social issues cannot mean excusing criminal actions.  

Understand and address social issues, without assuming people are automatically without guilt (or with guilt) simply for being part of a certain demographic.

And this is something with lots of nuance, and has to be looked at with critical thinking skills whenever any situation arises…that’s not just learning a specific ideal, solution, or belief…",,changemyview,7,2022,1
3551,iekspr9,t3_vod871,t1_iekk8up,7/2/22 6:55,rwhelser,,,1,FALSE,,public,t5_2w2s8,FALSE,FALSE,"Take a look at the examples I gave. Issues such as minimum wage, maintenance (such as roads), housing, and public assistance are all examples of policies that are much better handled at the state level compared to the federal level. 

Is it better to operate with only a federal minimum wage or is that better suited for the states? Or should every municipality out there conduct an economic analysis to determine what’s best for them (if you look at who is typically involved in local politics, and the way they operate, you might see why it’s better left to the state). If someone is seeking unemployment compensation or Medicaid benefits, should that be something Uncle Sam manages or should every city try to build up a massive budget to provide for that? Or are the states better off managing such programs. 

Often, states serve as policy testing grounds. Minimum wage, for example, was enacted at the state level before it became a federal law. More recently, the loosening of marijuana laws has been a state initiative even though Uncle Sam hasn’t followed suit (I suspect at some point in the not so distant future that will change). Gay marriage was a state level initiative until pushed to the federal level when DOMA was challenged in court (technically there’s no federal law out there saying gay marriage is illegal, in fact the opposite is what was struck down). Consider anything you need a license for. For example if every city had their own standard for driver’s licensing, would you prefer to have to get a license in every city you drive through in order be allowed to drive? Same for hunting and fishing licenses. Also keep in mind how much of a strain these issues would put on municipalities. You might think of a place like New York with a massive budget but consider some random township in the Midwest with a population of 50. 

With respect to your arguments about cities being shackled to the state, there have been instances where cities went against state and even federal policy. Take a look at sanctuary cities as a great example. Why don’t we see cities being more rebellious against state governments? Money. Same reason Uncle Sam can get states to fall in line. If a state goes against a federal policy one way to keep them in line is threatening to cut off federal funding (look at the covid vaccine debate for reserve and national guard members as an example). 

Fact of the matter is you can say you’re not interested in the constitutional argument but that’s the law of the land and it expressly gives power to the states. If you’re going to say I don’t care about the constitution argument then should it be on the cities to create/enforce constitutional rights because we don’t like one provision in the constitution? Should cities regulate their own free speech? Should cities form their own little militias, enact and enforce their own borders? Just keep in mind you can’t say “I don’t care about constitutional arguments” on one topic and then say you do on another. But I do understand where you were making your point. 

At the end of the day, there are policy issues best handled by Uncle Sam, and others best handled by state and local governments.",,changemyview,7,2022,1

In the real world, the majority of incest is abuse and non-consensual. You're talking about normalizing something that is *far more often* a form of sexual abuse for the sake of the very, very, very slim minority who maybe who aren't being abused. ""Father-daughter"" incest is th[e most common form of incest,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4010601) which is almost always abuse towards minors by their father, and ""Brother-sister"" incest is the second most common form, which is again, nearly always abusive. Over 70% of victims are left with psychological issues and 66.7% specifically have PTSD. It is most commonly a chronic, recurring form of abuse.

Consider also that consent is complicated in these relationships even when one or both parties may claim consent exists - the older party has more time, power, and ability to groom the other party into 'consenting' over time, as is the case with pedophilia and pedophilic relationships.

Sorry, but you don't get to cut out the reality of what incest *is* for a slim minority of cases within it that you think are fine to talk about normalization.

Okay Yeah I understand that, but Im questioning if it is a meaningful comparison. Since if new zealand had the same rate of school shootings (as per your example), there would be alot of shootings with 0 deaths (how common is that?). I think if one actually were to compare these nations and include some other reasonable statistics then the death rate would be quite higher.
And to be fair, new zealand is tiny, its population is comparable to norway, which is also tiny. Like if this rate existed for iceland, the vatican etc then there would be 0 deaths, but thats not really a meaningful way to discuss this topic.

The rate of occurrence is way more problematic in my opinion, and is arguably what affects the population, or media the most.

If anything, it solves exactly the problem you are talking about, since there would be much less need for subs if players only had to play half a game.

The best women are almost always going to be worse than the best men. One could argue it would change drastically because the best women likely aren't even better than the middle tier men. We see that play out in soccer when women's professional teams lose to men's college teams and in tennis when Serena Williams said she would lose to a male tennis player who is rank 200 in men's tennis. This would likely be the same or worse in a contact sport like football. I think you are underestimating the drop in play that would be evident when watching a half of men and a half of women.

That isn't the best of both worlds if the level of play is categorically different.

So should we teach minorities that they are oppressed and are just screwed?  No.  But there are indeed systemic issues in the US for many groups because of our history.  You are being willfully ignorant if you don’t believe that.  Just go look up situations like “Cancer Alley” in Louisiana as a small example.

Outlining and understanding that history is the only way to correct for that history.  Does that give for example black people an excuse to be lazy and say “woe is me”.  No.  But outlining and understanding why we have such differences in schooling and other opportunity and seeing how to fix it, requires studying it.  These things won’t just fix themselves.

For example.  I’m black, my dad grew up in the Jim Crow south.  Managed to escape it and give me a decent middle class upbringing.  I was one of the few minority kids in what was considered the best public school district in our state.  And I managed to get a good education and now send my kids to a top school district problem solved right?

Well my dad managed to escape his upbringing and do a better.  But many back in his hometown didn’t.  And he would smack anyone upside the head who said that “well you worked hard and those people left back there didn’t”. Bullshit, there were plenty of people in his hometown who worked damn hard in the system they were in but couldn’t get out for various circumstances.  Maybe they got married and had a kid where my dad was free to escape the south.  They needed to work in the blue collar jobs available to them which didn’t offer much upward mobility.  You can say “well don’t start a family”, well white people on the other side of town could fall in love and start a family in their 20s and still have plenty of upward mobility somehow even with just a high school education somehow.  My father needed to be top of his class and move to California far away from family support to get near the opportunities.  That legacy of differences still exist across generations. Where now there may not be explicit racial rules/laws dictating opportunity.  It switches to income which of course disproportionately hurts minorities, since they were forced to the areas of worst infrastructure, had highways destroy their neighborhoods and scatter them to the winds when white neighborhoods were left alone, etc. etc.  Yes you can find successful minorities.  But that doesn’t mean the inequities aren’t still there.

And let’s be frank.  The history of racism has been very much whitewashed, really even since reconstruction.  Just from the fact from me growing up in Texas, one of the former confederate states that drafted textbooks calling slavery the “3rd reason at best” for the Civil War just tells us how much if history taught was misleading and how much was omitted to make people feel better.",,changemyview,7,2022,2

If you look at it from an economic standpoint, both R and D were responsible for the rampant inflation we are experiencing now.

From 2016 to 2020, Trump pressured the Fed to lower rates to insanely low levels despite the economy being healthy enough to support interest rates remaining where they were. This gave the Fed much less leverage in terms of how much money they had in storage. 

By 2019 the interest rate (and consequently Fed money supply) was practically zero. They had just started raising rates when the pandemic hit and Biden got elected.

His economic recovery plan was a daunting undertaking for the Fed to enact, and was precisely the thing you don’t want to do when you have a thin money supply. The Fed’s hand was forced and had to print nearly half of all the money in circulation today over the past two years.

This devalued the dollar, and throughout 2021, inflation fears were fought off with the same “stock market go up” mentality that had been touted during the Trump presidency. Rates were kept near-zero through the recovery all the way up until about three months ago.

The last time inflation was this high, it took several multi-percent rate-hikes to bring it back down. The ones being enacted now are mere fractions of a percent.

Just like many in the pro-life crowd argue about guns, bans don’t work. All you are doing is going to force desperate women to put themselves in dangerous situations to try and abort, or you will be putting many women in prison. Women will die because of this.

Have you ever stopped to think about the societal impact of forcing unwanted children to be born? There is a pretty significant correlation between legalized abortion and the drop in crime in the 90’s.

“From 1991 to 2014, the violent and property crime rates each fell by 50%. Legalized abortion is estimated to have reduced violent crime by 47% and property crime by 33% over this period, and thus can explain most of the observed crime decline.”

A number of the examples of arguments you ""lost"" come from interactions you had online, but can you really win or lose an argument over the internet? The only people who can decide who is right are the two people arguing, so someone can just claim that they're right over and over and there's nothing you can do. But in real life, if someone uses cheap or bad faith tactics, it becomes much more obvious who the person in the right is, especially if there's an audience watching the discussion. It's not that traditional methods of debate are idealistic as much as it is that people can get away with cheaper tactics behind a screen than they can in public.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Second, even when dealing with cheap tricks, having strong debating skills is still important. If you had never learned how to debate properly, would you have been as aware of the tactics these people you argued with tried to pull? The key to avoiding being manipulated, and preventing someone you're trying to persuade from being manipulated, is to be aware of it when it's happening. As someone who's debated in high school myself, I've faced a number of people who try to use dishonest methods to force their way to a win, and knowing exactly what they're doing makes it easier to come up with a response.

Alex Morgan has a much higher status than any man in the US football team, even though she is a worse player than every one of them.

We are talking about quality because that's the reason people watch men's sports more than women's sports, and my entire point is that no one would be interested in watching a sport that has drastic swings in quality from quarter to quarter. 

Even your status point is flawed because the women's us team only has more status because they are way more successful than the men's team. In countries where the men's team compete at a high level, the best men have more status. 

&gt;I'm not underestimating it. It's just this has nothing to do with the discussion. No one is expecting the women to compare to the men. That's the whole reason they would be playing consecutively, not simultaneously.

If you aren't questioning the difference, then I don't understand how you think people would be willing to watch a game were the quality significantly decreases from quarter to quarter. That is a significantly worse tv product than watching an entire men's game or an entire woman's game. 

&gt;Best of both worlds means those players are among the best in their own category. It's all relative.

The relatively is exactly why it wouldn't be the best of both worlds. The setup of the game will naturally juxtapose the quality between men and women's sports. Brittany Griner is a damn good basketball player, but she is no where near the level of Joel Embiid and watching them play one after the other will expose that. Why watch Griner play for two quarters when you can watch Embiid play 4? 

&gt;Probably, but that's not really the aspect of the discussion I'm interested in. I'm arguing why it would be valuable to those who care about women's sports.

And that's cool but I am talking about the overall success of the sport. Doing something that would be more valuable to people interested in women's sports is counterintuitive if that move kills the overall popularity of the sport. You would be doing a disservice to all of the athletes, both men and women.

Edit: I will give you a real world example. The wnba operates at a loss and is heavily subsidized by the NBA which makes billions in profits. Reducing the popularity of the NBA would destroy the entirety of the wbna, leading to less opportunities for female players overall. Combining the sports means you either have to increase the player count to 30 players per team, or decrease the number of men and women playing by half to meet the typical 15 player roster. Anyway you slice it,  you are taking away opportunities from the mid level men and women in the sports because they would never get to play.",,changemyview,7,2022,2

First off, by 'conservatives', you really mean 'anti-abortionists'.

Next, there's no dispute anywhere that a fetus is 'life' and is alive. It is absolutely alive, just as a human, or a frog, or a growing tree is alive. If it weren't alive, it couldn't grow and develop. 

The question is whether the fetus has a right to force a woman to carry it.

We've had some discussions lately about trying to open better dialogue with our users and it might be a useful discussion to have over there with all of the mods.

A brief overview of the rules as I see them:


OP rules:


Rule A - Can't have a productive discussion unless you explain why you believe what you believe.

Rule B - Can't have a productive discussion unless both sides are willing to have an open mind.

Rule C - Good titles bring in people interested in the subject.

Rule D - In order to have a productive discussion, somebody has to throw out the first stab at a problem. Nobody is entirely without opinion on anything. The first poster has special power in CMV and should be forced to pick a side rather than playing both sides of an argument. 

Rule E - Can't have a productive discussion if nobody replies. We've had a lot of problems with trolls expressing an unpopular opinion, riling people up, then bouncing.


Comment rules:


Rule 1 - If you're simply agreeing with OP, you're not going to change their view. We're not here to reinforce views.

Rule 2 - Being rude to somebody is a quick way to shut down any chance of you changing their view.

Rule 3 - Telling somebody that they are arguing in bad faith only works to persuade third party viewers. If the person truly is engaged in bad faith argument, they are unlikely to be interested in changing their views. If they are not engaging in bad faith argument, then you alienate them and make them not want to change their view.

Rule 4 - Rewarding good posters fosters discussion that actually changes opinions.

Rule 5 - Offside comments, verbal upvotes and random jokes clutter up threads and make discussion difficult.",,changemyview,7,2022,2

&gt;CMV: The US is clearly declining because of the Republicans

I instantly imagine what politics would look like if Republicans didn't exist. If that were the case socialists would rewrite everything. If they didn't have a balancing effect The Green New Deal would be official policy and a lot of other wacky stuff.

I imagine what a court room would look like if there wasn't two opposing sides and that is my view change proposal.

If you want to hyper analyse San Fran then we can argue over police reporting all day but i'm trying to get you to imagine how much worse it would be without the moderating effect of Republicans.

How about the Covington Kid case? Our side does make mistakes and we do promote hatred even here on reddit. Just like in a court of law having another opposing side keeps us honest.

Maybe i'm swinging too wildly at the fences here but as you mature you will see the moderating effect of having two opposing parties.

If you want a more sophisticated conversation about specific policy then most of us have trouble understanding why Citizens United hasn't been repealed even though Dem's have been in power. It's quite clear that they're corrupt enough to enjoy massive secret donations, too.

In a society, for individuals to reason, it’s necessary that individuals have freedom from coercion to act according to reason. A society of freedom is one where the governments secures man’s right to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness. Rights are properly freedom’s of action. 

Yeah, the US is in decline. Yeah, the Republicans generally want America to be worse than it us now. But the Democrats are as bad or worse. 

&gt;Woman's rights to choose are being attacked, 

Yeah, man’s rights include the right to abort and the right to marry whomever he chooses, including more than one person. Yeah, many conservatives or republicans are anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage. But democrats or liberals don’t stand up for abortion or gay marriage. That is, they are so hypocritical about rights that they can’t stand up for those rights because they are so opposed to rights in other areas, particularly property rights. But also, the right to bodily autonomy also implies that the FDA is completely a violation of that, that prostitution should be legal, that all recreational drugs should be legal etc. 

&gt;Considering Republicans have gerrymandered the important states to hell and back their red assemblies will just decided to send their electoral votes to Republicans even if the state voted blue and turn the US into a 1 party state.

Both sides gerrymander, so it’s just completely wrong to blame gerrymandering on Republicans. It’s not like Republicans support gerrymandering while Democrats oppose it. 

&gt; For example, in 2022 alone, the Democrat-controlled Assembly in Maryland all but erased the sole Republican district in the state, the worst offenders in Illinois essentially Christmas-treed their districts to secure their majorities and pin Republican members against each other, and in New Mexico, the Democrats shifted an R+14 CD to a D+4 CD drastically impacting my Republican colleague, Yvette Herrell of the 2nd District.

From https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/590097-democrats-created-gerrymandering-they-must-own-it/

I don’t know who the worst offender is, and I don’t really care who started doing it first as that’s besides the point.

&gt;While yes that’s true, the ban of abortion simultaneously gives freedom to an unborn life. 

If this was true, why can't I claim fetuses as dependents on my tax returns?

&gt;A life that is as valuable as you and I.

Is it, though?  Let's say you were in an IVF clinic and a fire broke out, and smoke was pouring in.  On your right is a room with 1000 frozen embryos in a cart, while on your left is a room with a small child in it.  You only have time to save the embryos or the child, not both.  

Which do you choose?

&gt;There are countless horror stories of mothers killing their babies once outside the womb and they get served a life sentence. 

There are also plenty of horror stories of fathers beating their kids to death or violently causing miscarriages in their pregnant partners.

&gt;I’m sure that we can all agree that killing a born offspring is morally wrong.

Yes.

&gt;Well then what’s the difference in killing a baby before it’s born? Absolutely nothing. It’s still a life that should be cherished. 

The difference is that while a baby might depend on others to survive, a fetus depends on utilizing the mother's body specifically to survive.  If the mother does not consent to having her body utilized in this way, why should she be forced to risk her life and health through pregnancy?


&gt;Now let’s address the issue that people will certainly throw at this argument: rape. Even if a woman gets raped, she can take a plan B and have 99% chance of not having a baby.

You do know that tons of conservatives want to ban contraception, and plan B especially, too, right?  I mean Clarence Thomas literally wrote in his concurrence that he wanted to overturn Griswold, the case that ruled banning contraception was unconstitutional.

&gt;And that 1% probably didn’t take it within the suggested time frame.

So... Your solution is ""screw those women they don't matter""?  Like 1% of rape victims is still a lot of women.  How many women getting pregnant from rape is acceptable to you? What do you suggest those women do?

This just shows a huge lack of empathy for rape victims, honestly.

&gt;The freedom for women lies within the act of sex itself. 

Not when they're raped, which is something you seem to have just glossed over.

Plus, consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy.

&gt;It’s a woman’s choice to have unprotected sex. 

So if they didn't have unprotected sex, they can get an abortion?

&gt;It’s a woman’s choice to take birth control. 

Men can use condoms too, or get a vasectomy.

Also, again, really important to note that the same people who overturned Roe also want to ban contraception, so they do not want it to be a woman's choice to use contraception.

&gt;But it should never be a woman’s choice to take the life of an unborn offspring. CMV.

&gt; Inbreds often experience lopsided faces and shorter heights, both of which plastic surgery promises to fix. People with normal amounts of genetic diversity (as well as mixed people) have noticeably symmetrical faces and taller height, dramatically reducing the urge to cut and slice.

Wealthy people have more symmetrical faces (arising from their wealth shielding them from typical stressors) and are taller on average. If you follow this logic, plastic surgeries are for poor people, as wealthy people don't need any surgery to fix their height or non-existent facial lopsidedness.

Which seems to be **just** that Republicans exist. I mean your points are basically the screeching that has dominated the Left Wing's version of ""debating"".

[Here's the actual ruling.](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1530_n758.pdf). Read it and determine for yourself if it's some deathknell to fighting climate change. 

Second, Democracy is not ending because of court cases with results that you don't like. That is inherently selfish. The Supreme Court is *supposed to be* inherently conservative in their rulings. Not the political ideology conservative but conservative in that everything must have a precedent in the law that already exists. The States having the power to make decisions that are not based on an enumerated power of the federal government in the Constitution **IS** one of those precedents. How states conduct elections has been *their* purview for 200 years. They follow basic rules of fairness and equality but how they divide up representation is mostly up to them.

I personally do not. For me something morally wrong requires that someone be harmed. Babies don’t become aware until around 15 weeks so no one is really being harmed since they aren’t conscious yet. Now I would only allow post birth abortions in extreme situations but I could think of quite a few where it would be the morally correct thing to do. For example, this is a true story I cover in my ethics class.  say a baby is born with encephalopathy.  The doctor tells you as the parent that you have two options, you can let the baby starve and dehydrate to death, a slow painful death. Or they can spend millions of dollars to keep the baby alive for 3 months before it inevitably dies due to its unformed brain. In the meantime while we keep the baby alive for 3 months it’s suffering in pain. In my opinion neither of these two options is the morally ethical thing to do. The morally correct thing to do in this situation imo is to painlessly euthanize the baby.

But that's where you aren't making sense. Sure the people who don't watch women's sports probably aren't going to be interested, but for those who do, why do you think they wouldn't? They already know women are not as good players as men, and they are okay with it. They're already used to watching men's games some days and women's games some other days, even though the level is different.

Besides your ""no one"" is just factually wrong, since I'm saying I would be interested.

&gt; In countries where the men's team compete at a high level, the best men have more status. 

Sure, I'm not saying Cascarino has the same status as Mbappé, but she can be loved all the same by French supporters, and they can be happy to see a competition where both are playing.

&gt; I don't understand how you think people would be willing to watch a game were the quality significantly decreases from quarter to quarter.

Because not everyone has the same conception of what makes sports interesting. This aspect you bring up just isn't relevant to me. Because that's absolute level, not relative level. Since it's men playing against men, and women playing against women, it's always going to be a hard fought battle, which is what matters to me.

&gt; The relatively is exactly why it wouldn't be the best of both worlds.

I don't see how. I love the men's team, and I love the women's team, so watching them play a suspenseful game where both are bringing their own contribution to the score, would be like getting everything I love reunited in the same game. Hence the best of both worlds.

We listen to the same 4 chords with the same lyrics backed by loud and out of tune bass and harmonies.

This has caused us to lose our ability to critically listen to things because we have become used to how music should sound and only passively listen.

This is combined by the fact that music between genres has become very polarizing. This is not because of the musicians but rather by the producers and distributors of music. Music has been curated for us to feel specific things when we listen to it.

Because of this, when we communicate with others, we don't know how to critically listen to one another and actually think through what is actually being said and implied.

Part of this is public conditioning, but the other is that we as European/American humans do not understand how harmonics work and how all sound should be tuned.

If we do not understand the relationships, music becomes harder to listen to when it becomes more complex due to clashing of sound.

Wealth is a prerequisite, not a reason itself. Nobody gets plastic surgery just because they are wealthy, they get it because they view themselves as being imperfect or ugly in some way. Surely you don't think that of the people who are wealthy enough to get plastic surgery a majority are ugly due to inbreeding, do you? That is absurd! The vast majority are going to be less than ideal in appearance for the same reason everyone else is. It is just that people who are wealthy enough can address their insecurities via surgery.

Another flaw in your thinking is that many wealthy people who want to engage in inbreeding do so because of an interest in maintaining a ""pure"" family line. A lineage would have something like the Hapsburg Jaw because of inbreeding, but this trait wasn't a negative in their eyes. It was the whole point, the jaw was a sign of this lineage so there was nothing to ""fix"". If a family is aiming to inbreed then not looking like the family is a huge negative.

What baffles me is that why is this a decision for the supreme court in the US. Why not decide on it through democratic political decisions just like everything else. I am in the pro choice camp, but I see the two sides of the issue, which is why in my opinion the decision should be done politically, not by a court. Could some American tell me why people are so upset that this is made into a political question now? Shouldn't it always be that? 

The same thing with gay marriage. It has been legalized throughout the western world, not through courts but as a political decision and I supported it. In the US it was legalized through a backdoor as a court decision. To me this kind of decision making erodes the idea of democracy. And it makes things fragile, like now with the Dobbs decision.

If they use that position to advance an agenda, however noble it might otherwise be, they're acting as corrupt referees, which isn't good for the country's long-term health. Worse, if their rulings are made without law to back them up, then they're basically creating laws that people will then, in turn, rely on... and in doing so unfairly, discourage any fair judges from being added to the bench, as a fair judge would overturn those rulings.

Roe v Wade did not secure abortion rights. Obergefell v Hodges did not secure gay rights. These rulings *made those rights into hostages* that pressed the court into a politcal tool it should not have been. Or didn't you notice the continuous stream of ""Kevenaugh would overturn *Roe v Wade*"" back during his appointment? Or when they said the same thing about Amy Coney Barrett?

There's no argument to be had that allowing gay marriage would somehow violate the Constitution. If congress got its shit together and passed a law federally recognizing gay marriage as valid, nobody would give a damn what happens to Obergefell v Hodges as a ruling. Abortion... is more complicated, but if you want that policy in your state, you have state legislatures for that.

These cases caused a firestorm, but that's due primarily to the fact that previous administrations have left so much kindling laying around. We're in for a chaotic few years as everyone scrambles to get back to a point of stability, but in the long-term, things are looking up.",,changemyview,7,2022,2

Welfare might sound good but when its unlimited and universal it might cause negative influences which may worsen the country. The taxes and man power used to keep these supposedly good systems running might be better elsewhere. The differences in opinion and free speech on these aspects is what allows for people to find the actual best policies. 

There is also a multi trillion dollar debt to keep in mind so just spending money on anything and everything cause its good is going to cause problems. I love my wife and would love to buy her gifts every day, or go on trips, or buy things for the house but in the end of the day we have a budget.

I'm not claiming it's scientific at all, and this isn't a slippery slope argument.  I'm just trying to point out that the decision you're referencing did not grant any more freedoms to fetuses, because they are not treated as persons under the law and this decision does nothing to change that.  The Dobbs decision doesn't grant any new freedoms to anyone It just takes it away from those seeking abortions.

&gt;The scenario that you described in the hospital is unlikely, and hopefully both could be saved. They are equally valuable. 

So you agree that embryos are less valuable because 1000 embryos is equally as valuable as one living child?


&gt;Sex should be reframed that a woman consents to sex AND the possibility of conception while having unprotected sex. 

Why? 

And even if this is the case, consenting to the possibility of conception is not the same as consenting to being pregnant.

&gt;I don’t think contraceptives should be banned. I’m not conservative or liberal. I enjoy science, and banning contraceptives is very unintelligent.

Then you shouldn't think the decision overturning Roe v. Wade is good and your view should change because the logic used in the majority decision of Dobbs can be used directly to overturn Griswold and allow for the banning of contraception. In fact, Clarence Thomas's dissent explicitly calls for it.  Even if you agree with the outcome that abortion is banned, you should disagree with this decision if you are really consistent enough to be opposed to


&gt;Yes, the 1% certainly leaves a grey area, but it shouldn’t just make it ok for a woman to abort who was not raped. There are the possibility of statutes to give exceptions to these women.

And there is the possibility that they don't. In fact, Texas has a trigger law that will be implemented 30 days after the Dobbs decision goes into effect that will ban all abortions after 6 weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest, ONLY to save the life of the mother.

The Dobbs decision the you are defending does not clarify whether exceptions for rape or to save the life of the mother should be made.  It just overturns Roe and leaves it up to states, several of which have bans in place that do not have those exceptions.

Therefore, if you support the decision that you are currently defending, you are saying that you support some women being prevented from having an abortion in the case that they get raped or to save their life.

&gt;I empathize with rape victims. But taking a plan B will fix most cases.

And in the cases it doesn't? You really need to answer that.


&gt;For your last point, this is why safe sex and prevention needs to be #1. Mothers nor babies deserve to die

You are just dodging the question. Again, the decision you are supporting makes no clarification as to whether abortion should be allowed to save the life of the mother. It leaves that up to the states, some of which may not decide to do that.

Do you support that? Do you think it is okay for women to be banned from having an abortion even in cases where it would save their life?",,changemyview,7,2022,2

Your idea would fit very well in the relays (running, swimming, skiing, whatever) and it is actually been introduced in many Olympic sports.

Hundreds of factories had shut down in China alone, thousands across the globe. Semiconductors are not more expensive due to shipping costs that a company could pay with debt, they were *unavailable*, and still in short supply globally. The refinery I worked at is constantly down for days waiting for parts that are still in short supply. Fertilizer, imported from Asia wasn't just more expensive to ship, it was not being shipped. Food costs soared and there were shortages. There still are. 
And that's just supply issues. Labor was unavailable in many industries, take a look at the petroleum industry (where I have a decade of experience). Refineries were shut down, the largest refiner, Marathon, alone shut down 7 refineries. It takes months to start a refinery back up and they are still short on the specialized labor to do so. The refineries running now are operating at over 90% capacity. This is much more expensive as the normal capacity is 80-85%. Over 90% means a refinery is shut more often for maintenance.

Even if a woman gets raped, she can take a plan B and have 99% chance of not having a baby. And that 1% probably didn’t take it within the suggested time frame.

This shows you clearly lack understanding of what the pill does, because it heavily relies on where in the cycle a woman is. Plan B works mainly / only to delay ovulation, because sperm survives in a womb for roughly 72 hours. If ovulation has occurred it is heavily debated and as far as I know there is no decent evidence to show that it can prevent implantation (although theoretically it can reduce the chance). 

Because even the delay in ovulation is not a 100% guarantee, the idea that it works 99% is just dumb, let alone that the reason it doesn’t work for the “1%” is because they took it wrong. Others have already enlightened you on how often it actually works.

That is an end result that doesn’t rely on an argument that’s just “oh well it wasn’t a federal power so we’re allocating it properly”. The outcome changed. And for the worse of people despite other’s moral views. Same for most of these issues. 

When judges lie in their hearings about their views which are obvious and then make decisions perfectly in line with their political ideology, they are political. No judge up there is making decisions without their personal beliefs. That goes for both sides. I’ll change my mind when the court starts making votes and decisions that are actually surprising. 

There’s also a line between legal and moral that I think is being missed here by many people taking a conservative argument. Just because something is in writing, be it law, constitution, or the bible, doesn’t make it automatically right or a precedent that we should be following for years to come just because.

&gt;Republicans are becoming more openly Facist by the second 

How so? Are you aware of what fascism is?
&gt; US democracy is also ending (yes I know it's actually a Federal Democratic Representative Constitutional Republic but its functionally the same argument), with the Trump Court hearing a case that they will 99.999% rule in favor of Republicans the states will have the absolute authority to conduct elections without even the state court being able to intervene. 

The Supreme Court does not rule “in favor” of a political party, they invalidate laws or statues that violate provisions of the Constitution. They are accountable to the Constitution and their interpretation of it. 

It should be noted that every member of the Supreme Court had to be confirmed by Congress. Your representatives confirmed these people, people elected by you. Take some responsibility about how you vote from now on and recognize that it matters.
&gt; Considering Republicans have gerrymandered the important states to hell and back their red assemblies will just decided to send their electoral votes to Republicans even if the state voted blue and turn the US into a 1 party state.

You realize that Gerrymandering was a product of the Democratic Party right? Let’s not turn a blind eye to their Gerrymandering in states like New York and Illinois. 
&gt; It's obvious that the Republican Party are the source of all the nation’s problems.

But it’s not. How is a party, that has a minority in the legislative branch and does not control the executive branch, the source of the countries problems? That’s like saying that racial minorities are the cause of our nations problems.
&gt; we can't ever get proven to work European social programs because they screech about ""muh taxes"" and ""muh entitlement"" 

The Federal Government takes nearly 25% of my income every year. I do not want to fund social programs, I want to retain what I earned. I want to build equity and live the American dream. But I can’t do that if Democrats always have their hands out, demanding money from the taxpayer.
&gt; because God forbid Bob making $100,000,000 a year and who has 10 Ferraris in the garage pay $0.01 extra in tax, 

Imagine for a moment that you are in a math class. You do all of your homework, study really hard and ace every test. You are given a 100%, A+ in the class. Another student, who talks in class, doesn’t do homework and fails every test, gets a 43%, F in the class. The teacher tells you that in order to help this student, you have to sacrifice 30% of your grade so that he can pass with a 73%. This is the logic here. It doesn’t make sense right? People should be entitled to the fruits of their hard work. 

BTW, [people who make over $540,000, have to sacrifice 37% of that to the Federal Government.](https://www.aarp.org/money/taxes/info-2020/income-tax-brackets.html?cmp=KNC-DSO-COR-Core-Money-NonBrand-Phrase-30842-GOOG-MONY-TaxBrackets-Phrase-NonBrand&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw2f-VBhAsEiwAO4lNeJMHXRcMwfy6Xof3ZSTm1WW5YUlscuzH6veaa7zGKJWwbIeqjycSBhoC9p8QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw) That’s over a third of that person’s income.

I picked out the relevant info so you don’t have to read the whole thing but feel free too

One observation that has been attributed to scientific consensus—one that is highly relevant to our field—is the concept that “human life begins at fertilization.” This statement is commonly offered by religious organizations and is often cited as the basis for so-called personhood amendments, but the assertion that it is scientifically sound is incorrect. And although it is often offered in the context of abortion, it has profound ramifications for the treatment of infertility, particularly for in vitro fertilization (IVF). We fertility doctors take extreme care to protect and nurture the preimplantation embryos in our incubators and cryotanks. We realize that in almost all cases these aggregates of cells represent the best chance for our infertile couples to realize their dream of building their families. However, handling an embryo with the potential to produce a pregnancy is not the same as handling a human life. If harm to a preimplantation embryo were to be considered the same as harm to a human being, then the demise of a preimplantation embryo—a not infrequent event in vivo, as well as in the IVF laboratory—might well be treated as a human death, perhaps with manslaughter charges brought against the embryologists.
What is scientifically incorrect about saying that human life begins at fertilization? First, it is a categorical designation in conflict with the scientific observation that life is a continuum. The egg cell is alive, and it has the potential to become a zygote (a single-celled embryo) if it is appropriately fertilized and activated by a live sperm. If fertilization is successful and the genetic complement of the sperm is added to that of the egg, the resulting zygote is also alive. The zygote has the same size as the egg; other than for its new genotype, the cell (comprising the cytoplasm and the rest) is nearly identical to the egg cell. From a biological perspective, no new life has been created.
Second, “human life” implies individuality, which is also not consistent with scientific observations. In the clinical practice of IVF, we often speak of preimplantation embryos as individual entities, with distinct qualities like a specific genotype (mosaicism notwithstanding), and morphologic and developmental characteristics. But at the same time we realize that each of the totipotent cells that comprise these embryos is, at least theoretically, capable of producing a complete new individual. Indeed, multiple individuals can arise from the implantation of a single embryo, as in the case of identical twins. Therefore, we know that the preimplantation embryo is not actually an individual. The preimplantation embryo is essentially an aggregate of stem cells, which has the potential to produce a pregnancy, including placental and fetal tissues, assuming that it successfully implants in a receptive endometrium. It is only after implantation that the early embryo can further differentiate into the organized cell groups that enable the developing conceptus to progress further in embryonic and eventually fetal development.
“Life begins at fertilization” may certainly be considered a religious concept; because religious ideas are based on faith, no further proof is necessary. It is pointless to use science as an argument against faith-based dictums. For example, it is also not in the realm of science to investigate the nature of life after death or the validity of holy books. The beginning of human life likewise occupies the legal realm, where line drawing can be essential to the application of civil and criminal law. But laws are created by legislators, not scientists. Many attempts already have been made to legally define life as beginning at fertilization. Although the impetus for this type of legislation is likely religious, a supporting argument is often made that this is a scientific fact as well, which is in contradiction to the arguments presented here.",,changemyview,7,2022,2

Sure the people who don't watch women's sports probably aren't going to be interested, but for those who do, why do you think they wouldn't? They already know women are not as good players as men, and they are okay with it. They're already used to watching men's games some days and women's games some other days, even though the level is different.
Besides your ""no one"" is just factually wrong, since I'm saying I would be interested

What I'm saying makes perfect sense because watch a full game of men and women is drastically different from watching half and half. The pacing and quality would change drastically and that would be jarring. The overall quality of the product would decrease. And fair, no one is factually incorrect. Practically no one would be more accurate. 

&gt;Sure, I'm not saying Cascarino has the same status as Mbappé, but she can be loved all the same by French supporters, and they can be happy to see a competition where both are playing.

I doubt they would be happy if it was a game were both were playing. They would likely discount the half the women played and place more emphasis on the half the men did. Once again, due to the drastic change in quality from half to half. 

&gt;Because not everyone has the same conception of what makes sports interesting. This aspect you bring up just isn't relevant to me. Because that's absolute level, not relative level. Since it's men playing against men, and women playing against women, it's always going to be a hard fought battle, which is what matters to me.

Most people who are interested in professional sports are interested in watching elite athletes playing at the highest level. That is why men's sports are more popular than women's sports in general and it is why the US women's team is more popular than the men's team. The teams that are more successful at a high level, get the viewers attention. And it is on a relative level when you combine the sports because you will see that the quarters men play are of a better quality than the quarters the women play. That's why I brought up garbage time and it's why fans tend to discount wins when the winning side is at full strength while the losers are playing with key injuries. The difference in quality is the deciding factor. 

&gt;I don't see how. I love the men's team, and I love the women's team, so watching them play a suspenseful game where both are bringing their own contribution to the score, would be like getting everything I love reunited in the same game. Hence the best of both worlds

I am telling you how it would be different. Because the two halves would be entirely different in pace and quality. You would be watching 1 half of two different games. It would be like watching an NBA game until half time, changing the channel to watch the second half of a wnba game, and then tallying the final score based on both halves. That won't be interesting to most fans due to the drastic differences in each sport. 

&gt;I think you are confusing the quality of the players with the interest one would have in watching them
 
What's actually happening is you are attempting to divorce the  quality of the players from the interest a fan would have, when these two things are inexorably linked. This plays out at every level in every sports with only a few exceptions. Professional sports are the most popular and the popularity decreases as the level of play decreases. They are directly proportional to each other. The relative quality of the players is exactly why men's sports are preferred to women's sports. If you don't think so, why do you think the general sports fan prefers to watch men's sports instead of women's sports? Do you think the difference is entirely due to sexism?",,changemyview,7,2022,2

The reason for this is due to the conflicting world views of the two parties; the Republican party, as a rule, believes the system must be maintained. The Democrats, as a rule, believe they should have power.

Nowhere is this more blatant than Rowe vs Wade. The purpose of the Supreme Court is, in brief, to interpret the Constitution and determine what rights, privileges and responsibilities are contained therein, and then call for actions to be taken, or prohibited based on that document. As there is absolutely no mention of abortion anywhere within the Constitution, the Supreme Court has correctly ruled that the Federal Government has no mandate to make *any* ruling on abortion - for *or* against.

So, the ""anti-abortion"" Republicans have not made abortion illegal, and they have in fact given Democrat states the right to enact whatever pro-abortion laws they wish.

When the Supreme Court was pro-Democrat, they abused their authority to enact unconstitutional rulings. They created an extremely flimsy justification to push their wants onto the entire nation, effectively deciding that because *they* were pro-life, *everyone* must be pro-life.

The Left sees nothing wrong with abusing the system in this way because the abuse gives them power. The Left is, as a rule, operating under the creed of ""there is no truth, but only power."" Things are only true so long as it benefits them, and the moment it ceases to benefit them it becomes 'misinformation'. There is no coherent value system underpinning this behaviour, which is why Democrats will happily blame Trump and the Republicans in general for things *they* have enacted. Hillary Clinton made up Russiagate, but Democrats have no interest in punishing her. Joe Biden is guilty of corruption and colluding with foreign governments, but there is no need to pursue that. Obama set up and operated the ""concentration camps"" used to house migrants on the border, but only Republicans are to be blamed for their use.

There is no truth, but only power.

Republicans do not believe this. Or rather, they didn't believe this - what we are seeing now is that the Republicans have begun to recognise the fact that the Democrats do not play fair and will not respect the rule of law unless it benefits them to do so. Democracy only works so long as *all* parties accept the rules of the game; it is not reasonable to blame the Republicans for cheating now when their opponent has been cheating since before you were born.",,changemyview,7,2022,2

This comment is making me think and reflect. I think you're right! My idea of self-love has likely been influenced by working with my particular clinical population, people recovering from addictions. When I hear questions about self-love, mostly people are asking ""how do I forgive myself for things I've done wrong in active addiction and how do I change the beliefs I have about myself that are rooted in shame?"" Manicures would feel like a trite and dismissive answer to these questions, but that doesn't mean there isn't a client out there who could find such a suggestion helpful. 

  
My graduate program also heavily emphasized the role of introspection and self-discovery as keys to self-love, as well as the importance of working through past trauma and reworking negative core beliefs about self. My program wasn't very into behaviorism and I had several profs who shared a lot of criticisms about CBT. Manicures would not fit neatly into the framework I was taught in school, nor would they seem to be an appropriate answer to the particular questions I get asked by my clients. But, reading more responses on this thread and also reading some articles about what self-love means to others, I'm seeing that self-love can be inextricably tied to self-care for some people, and that's OK. I guess it's really a question of changing behaviors first (focusing on self-care) or changing attitudes first. Now that I think about it this way, I'm accepting that neither approach is more valid than another. My hope for everyone is that they ultimately find a sense of deep compassion and acceptance for themselves, and if manicures open the door for a person to find that, then power to them.",,changemyview,7,2022,2

I don't know if you've actually read the opinion on Roe v. Wade, but for your benefit, if you haven't, I'll link it here:

In summation, the argument goes that the criminalization of abortions not deemed necessary to save the life of the mother (yes, that provision existed even *way back when* this case was first argued) was a violation of the individual's implicit (not explicit) right to privacy, and a violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. *How* it was supposed to do that is barely elaborated upon; the opinion waffles on for a while about the lack of precedent for abortion bans in the law but gives almost no basis for why they would be considered unconstitutional.

In even more succinct terms, they made up that ""right"" essentially on the spot.

And nobody, not even supposed pro-choice activists, really backed it up. Democrats even enjoyed a majority in the House and Senate between *Roe* and now, along with controlling the presidency. If they wanted to, they could easily have passed federal legislation garaunteeing a right ro abortion. Which then would have left the issue out of the SCOTUS's hands unless someone came forward with a case that *abortion itself* was unconstitutional (which would have been logistically pretty difficult, to say the least). As it stood, all the court needed to do was say that abortion bans weren't unconstitutional, and the whole house of cards would collapse.

When there aren't any good options to choose from, people choose their opinion of the ""lesser evil"", or vote for a garbage candidate just because they're a part of their party and they refuse to vote for the opposing party, even if the candidate is better.

I myself am a registered republican, but refused to vote for Trump, can't stand him, and also voted for Obama twice, and Biden once. I wish people would keep an open mind to the bigger picture of politics rather than focus on the American polarization.

&gt;Politicians are exactly as crappy as voters let them be. If voters were smarter or demanded better results, politicians would have to go along.

You're absolutely right.

&gt;Republicans currently have a decent chance of winning back control of one or both houses of Congress, in large part because people are angry at Biden about inflation and gas prices. Even though Biden isn't on the ballot

Biden already said he'd run again. And yeah I get the feeling Republicans are going to win on the majority of ballots for a historical republican win overall, which even as a registered republican, I don't think is good. Too many of either side tends to shift the country into a bad direction. 

&gt;Republicans have put forward no real plan to address either of those issues. But they don't need to explain any of that, because Joe Voter is angry and riling him up is enough to win his vote. That's not a recipe for stellar political results.

More fracking, a better relationship with the Saudis, and any hope of a future career in the oil industry are all things Republicans can offer better them Democrats.

I'm all for green energy (I work in the field in fact), but we're trying to move away from fossil fuels faster than we can sustain right now, and telling the people who you've promised to end their jobs that you need them to work harder at their jobs before you essentially lead them to the unemployment line is a foolish thing to expect to work.

Encouragement of promiscuity, ridicule of “traditional” family values, idolization of the individual personality over anything else, encouraging the continuation of racial, gender, and other division based on identity, instead of bringing us together.

That's great, I'm genuinely happy you had that experience if that's the way you want to remember it, I'm really not being sarcastic I promise.

However, usually these conversations aren't really about individual instances like yours so much as they are about policy and what kinds of relationships we should encourage. There's a broad disagreement across the world as to exactly when people are capable of consenting to sex, which is why the age of consent varies by country and locality, but there's a general understanding that we have to draw the line somewhere because a lot of adolescents are just not able to make an informed decision to consent to sex (not because they are dumb or anything, but because they just aren't ready).  When exactly people become capable of making that decision probably varies by individual, which is why I said it's possible you may have been able to fully and rationally consent.

Still, I think even in your case there is some details that are worth thinking about. Perhaps you just got lucky, but in a lot of cases a 25-year-old person who is cruising for 15-year-olds despite the likely vast differences in life experience and circumstance is probably not doing so with non-creepy motivations.  There's a huge asymmetry in life experience and knowledge, not to mention financial and social independence, between the average 25 year old and the average 15 year old.  That makes those kinds of interactions and any potential relationship hugely susceptible to abuse and manipulation.

So when people make these criticisms of what you went through, maybe try and think about what the majority of cases like yours probably look like. Because as somebody who used to work in an adolescent psych ward who saw a lot of abuse victims, I can tell you that most of the times I've ever heard of a 25-year-old cruising for 15-year-olds, it did not end with a totally happy consensual encounter.",,changemyview,7,2022,2

So I use this example a lot, but there is this old story from the Edda about Loki. He is gambling with some dwarves and he bets his head. Predictably, he loses, and when they come to collect he goes 'ah ah ah, you are welcome to my head, but I didn't wager any of my neck'.

Everyone sits around arguing, trying to figure out where to make the cut, before finally giving up and just sewing his lips shut for being an annoying asshole.

The story serves to emphasize that while there can be a gray area in any subject, distinct things *do* exist, and trying to make the argument about where the line is is kind of a dick move. We know a head exists, and we know a neck exists, even if we can't tell you precisely where one ends and the other begins.

This logic drives a lot of our day to day life and policy. We *know* that adults shouldn't be fucking kids, and we *know* that it is okay for consenting adults to fuck. We even acknowledge, with things like Romeo and Juliet laws, that the gray zone in the middle exists and can be hard to quantify.

But part of setting laws is setting them as a standard norm. For every person like you who willingly had sex with someone a decade older than you, there is someone like my foster kid who was routinely sexually abused by someone a decade older than him, but thought (at the time) that it was consensual.

As a society, it is far, far better to set specific limits and say 'you can't do this' than to try and judge each instance on a case by case basis. Doubly so because for every person like you, there are probably a dozen people who just got raped by adults. We've drawn a distinct black line through that gray area, because the alternative is unacceptable.

I don't. I'm indifferent towards it. It's a necessary right.

&gt; What I mean by that is the true issue that does not get enough attention is unwanted pregnancies. We will never be able to prevent all unwanted pregnancies, just like we will never be able to prevent murder, burglary, or speeding. But I honestly believe there are so many ways we could make it better. The problem is our resources are spent lobbing metaphorical grenades back and forth.

We need to be careful not to present abortion as just being about cases where birth control failed.

I (and many others on the pro-choice side) also support the ability for women to change their minds even when they intentionally got pregnant, e.g. when reconsidering the risks of pregnancy, or their financial situation has changed (e.g. they lost their job) and they can't take care of their child in those circumstances.

An interesting fact is that in the US, only [12% of adults](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/08/15/abortion-viewed-in-moral-terms/#morality-of-using-in-vitro-fertilization) are on average against IVF, even though it literally results in the destruction of millions of embryos.

Is the US perhaps going trough a de-urbanization? If so, why? If not, what is this phenomena?

2 - local taxes, federal taxes and de facto social aid. Blue states have higher taxation per income, but how much of this taxation is reflected in infrastructure and aid on said states? Couple this with the fact that most red states get much money from the federal government. Are the urban states funding the development of rural states? If so, do politics play a part?

You need to grasp that no everyone has the same morality and ethics as you.

The reason for the decision, from what I understand, is that the agency had to much power to interpret laws as it saw fit, which is the job of Congress (I haven't followed it closely because I'm sick of the radicalization). This does not match up with your statement about Republicans being Fascist because 1. This is *less* government control and 2. Fascist environmental policy was radically different than Republicans based on which country you were in. You should see what Nazi Animal Welfare laws were like.

Also about calling Republicans Fascist. This shows you don't know what Fascism is. Fascism regulates buisiness a lot more. It centers around an economic theory that rejects capitalism and socialism for class collaboration/corporatism (which is not big business controlling everything. That's corporatocracy. Corporatism forces buisiness to negotiate with labor. (Just a Warning: You're talking to someone who will use things like Doctrine of Fascism as sources if you try to argue this.) Decreasing regulation also is literally the opposite of any form of Fascism.

Now another point I need to point out:

If you read the constitution, Republicans are looking specifically what it says on the paper. They aren't caring about your feelings. Roe v Wade was overturned because it was legislating from the bench, which means you have a group of people appointed for life making the Rules. Democrats had decades to codify it into law but did nothing. If you want someone to blame, blame both sides since one side

So on to the decline

You defined it has reduction in quality of life. Find a place in the country, red or blue, that has not had reductions in the quality of life. Costs of living are skyrocketing. Gas prices are climbing. The homeless situation in some cities are out of hand. So is it necessarily Republicans fault or do both sides sit on their asses and blame the opposition?

Democrats with their affordable healthcare? Yeah you can qualify if you are so poor you can't eat and your quality of life is already shit. Throwing a bone to the poor for votes

Republicans standing around offering no solutions besides blaming Democrats? Sitting around doing nothing.

Why don't you blame all the senile, old politicians and the two party system? The reason America is like this: New ideas and third parties that actually bring alternate solutions are opposed to hell and back by the establishment so nothing gets done.

This is, yes, a both sides bad comment but that's because both sides are bad and only give a shit about getting votes. If they fulfilled all their campaign promises, what would they run on next election?",,changemyview,7,2022,2

It's a rural urban divide thing in a bunch of states. Republicans in rural areas don't like the liberals in the big cities. Extend this to cops from out of town policing protests in the town they work in and you've got an issue with unnecessary violence. It's part of the reason Portland protests make the news so often. 

&gt;Which leaves us with the problem I outlined - what about the local cops defending the locals when the locals are the problem?

Also an issue. A huge one. But not really something a state mixing cops around would solve in a lot of cases. As a historical example you have something like lynch mobs in Kentucky https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainey_Bethea. I don't think it would've mattered where the cops in each town are from in Kentucky back in the late 18-mid 1900s. They're going to have a similar reaction because the state itself expects them to act in a certain very racist way. 

I'm worried shuffling cops statewide will cause more issues than it would solve. Caring about locals is usually a good thing, and sometimes really bad.

Neither party has adequately addressed this decline.  You want social programs and a legislated right to abortion?  Obama could have adopted both when Democrats had the White House and Congress in 2009, but they didn’t.

The US system seems to be set up to result in gridlock, and the media amplifies the voices of the lunatic fringes.  So nothing much gets done and we hear the crazies on both sides (The Squad, you count, too), even though they don’t really accomplish much other than noise.

So it’s really an issue of a governmental system that is designed to be stuck in internal strife and is designed to result in two parties effectively sharing power. If the US had a parliamentary system like the UK or even a different electoral system like proportional representation, US governance could be far different.

Rape :  unlawful sexual activity and usually sexual intercourse carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against a person's will or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent because of mental illness, mental deficiency, intoxication, unconsciousness, or deception

This is pretty much the working legal definition of rape. Now, if I may focus your attention on this highlighted passage.

&gt; [...] sexual intercourse carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against a person's will **or with a person who is beneath a certain age** [...]

This means that rape may be very much consensual sex if the person is beneath a certain age. In the US, for example, the age of consent is either 16,17, or 18 depending on the state. This kind of ""non-forced"" rape has its own legal category called statutory rape and carries a lighter sentence. 

&gt; I feel very frustrated by people deciding that because I was minor I wasn't able to consent to it.

Well, you were. Hence why statutory rape category exists, in recognition that things are a bit wonkier and not just black and white and it does carry a lighter sentence as a result of it. There are also Romeo and Juliet laws for underage people who are close age-wise, etc...

 What you weren't able to do is  **legally** able to consent to it because we as a society decided that there are certain actions minors aren't able to decide **legally** by and for themselves. Sex is just another thing you cannot legally do at that age.

You were raped because legally that is how we define rape. What I suspect you weren't was groomed or coerced into it. However, if I may once again focus your attention on the highlighted ""or"" statement above, forcing someone into it isn't a necessary requirement of rape.",,changemyview,7,2022,2

Around a third of our federal spending goes to military, around a quarter to Social Security and Medicare, and about half of the remainder (~20%) goes to servicing interest on the debt. 

About 10% of the federal budget goes to social safety net programs.

For education: 4 of the top 5 states for education are consistently run by democrats. New jersey, massachusets, washington, and colorado. Are 1, 2, 4, 5 respectively. The only conservative run state to crack the top 5 us florida which only made it because of its ranked 1 for college and 16th for k-12. And the bottom five are all states that have long time been conservative bastions.  So it would seem states governed by democrats tend to offer better educational options. 

I don’t really see why high taxes matter if the state offers good services. And again. Texans sponge off of liberal states because it consumes more federal income than it generates. If states like California got rid of their income tax they would most likely start requiring more federal dollars rather than provide for themselves. Californians pay more because Texans essentially can’t pull their own weight. 

And your “freedom index” is blatant conservative propaganda. The methodology it links to takes you to the website of a conservative think tank.

This court doesn’t support what’s called substantive due process: the right to privacy Chief among them underlying abortion and marriage etc. So gun owners should be really thankful they’re not in this position pro abortion people say they’re in, because it takes a lot of convincing to keep gun prohibitions except for licensing requirements, “sensitive places”, mental health etc. it’s like the freedom of speech content vs. the freedom to buy a sex toy: one is the strictest scrutiny by a court, the other is intermediate and like abortion will probably be what’s called rational basis. 

In other words anything a state calls a good reason to regulate is probably acceptable by courts.

Interesting altho moot point. There cannot be competing rights to bodily autonomy, that is not how the law works.

* The Supreme Court is not a cause of this decline
* Democrats are playing a major role in this decline as well. Whether it's the same amount as Republicans, I don't really know, and I don't think is a particularly interesting or productive conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Supreme Court's Role**

First, unlike what you've said (""99.% likely to side with Republicans""), the Supreme Court is 74% likely to side with Republicans. I lost the NYTimes graphic showing that, unfortunately. That's high - highest since FDR - but not 99% high. Importantly, the Court's opinions have been rather consistent: the government can't use increasingly complex readings of the Constitution and the Law and executive orders to solve problems it's not been plainly authorized to solve by Congress. In other words, Congress being paralyzed into inaction is no excuse for reinterpreting law to solve the problems Congress is unable to solve. 

That puts the US behind and cuts the tools the administration has to solve extremely pressing problems, most importantly climate change. But it's not the Court that's cutting those tools; Congress never made them. The fault for this inability to solve new problems in the US falls squarely on Congress, not the court. Congress has to pass legislation to regulate power plants and make abortion legal everywhere. That's how we're supposed to solve problems in this country.

Republicans gerrymander (as do Democrats, somewhat to a lesser extent, not by their own choosing), but both seem to play to incentives other than solving problems. For example, the Biden administration wanted to pass the most ambitious climate package in history and one of the most ambitious ones in the world, but Congressional Democrats wrapped it in a million other divisive priorities, s.a., home health aides, and it was never passed. Seems like their incentive is to introduce massive, trillion-dollar bills and fight to not pass them as opposed to ambitious but focused legislation that actually gets votes.

**Democrats and American Decline**

Nothing in this section is to suggest that Democrats are more responsible for American decline than Republicans, I am simply focusing on them. For this section I will focus on my home state and city of NY/NYC.

The bottom line is simple. Democrats have super-majorities in the city government and state government. The executives of both (mayor of NYC, governor of NY) are Democrats. The state and city coffers are both flush with cash. Yet NY is in decline; the streets are more dangerous, city services are declining in quality, rents and the overall costs of living are rising, and the traffic is constant gridlock. Despite bring governed by Democrats with no opposition and having practically unlimited resources, the city is becoming less habitable by day when we should be a liberal utopia. On a Federal level, Democrats can point fingers to Republicans, the Court, conservative Democrats, etc.; here, none of that exists.

For minorities, they are doing less well than they did decades ago in terms of enrollment in good schools, despite having a more representative government.

With regards to the health of democracy, Democrats are not much better. Three qualified candidates ran in this year's gubernatorial primary; the state party endorsed one of them before the primary and held what can only be described as a coronation for that candidate with Hillary Clinton presiding. They held a separate primary to lower turnout. In practice, about 800,000 voters ended up choosing the next governor of NY. Not as public or violent as January 6, but hardly democratic. They did without pressure; the winner of a competitive primary would have been the prohibitive favorite in the general.

What is the reason for this? I don't know. My opinion is that it has to do with progressive Democrats attacking success more than they actually promote more access for the less fortunate, and focusing on social issues that are unopposed in NY over table issues. My local senator talks almost exclusively about LGBT issues, which while important, are unanimously agreed upon in this state. His last newsletter was about Ron DeSantis coming to speak at a local event. He doesn't talk about rent or crime, which are the kinds of basic issues that a society needs to solve to progress.

If Republicans disappeared overnight, the closest reasonable situation we can expect the country to be in is NY. That's as much decline as Florida and Texas, which is the most reasonable situation we can expect the country to be in if the Democrats disappeared overnight, although in different ways. Hence Democrats are also contributing as well to our decline.

**TLDR; America is in decline, but it is driven not by the Court or Republicans but by the lack of responsibility of the government to its constituents on both sides. While maybe Republicans are more guilty than Democrats they're surely not the sole cause.**",,changemyview,7,2022,2

&gt; I believe that the US is declining. As Republicans keep scoring victory after victory with the Trump Court it's become increasingly clear that the US is in decline. Woman's rights to choose are being attacked, gay marriage is being attacked, trans people are REALLY being attacked

Republicans were saying ""America is in decline"" when things were becoming more progressive. It goes back and forth. That's how it's always been. Ultimately, I think many of those things mean very little when it evaluating whether a state is in decline.

&gt;  and people are losing more civil rights by the day.

You're going to have to give some more substantial examples of civil rights being lost specifically because of Republicans

&gt; The EPA, one of the most effective federal agencies can no longer protect our skies and water effectively because god forbid we put any regulations on the Corporations

Can't speak for the EPA stuff, because I'm not up to date on US environmental policy. However, people crying about regulating corporations has been a thing for decades. Not new, and you can't put the blame solely on Republicans for this.

&gt; and Republicans are becoming more openly Facist by the second

This is meaningless hyperbole. The US is not even remotely close to Fascism. 

&gt; US democracy is also ending (yes I know it's actually a Federal Democratic Representative Constitutional Republic but its functionally the same argument), with the Trump Court hearing a case that they will 99.999% rule in favor of Republicans the states will have the absolute authority to conduct elections without even the state court being able to intervene.

The system is in place that way so that the highly urbanized states (such as California) can't just decide the election on their own. As much as you might want that, since urban regions tend to vote Democrat, that would not be fair to those living in rural regions. Both the Democrats and the Republicans win elections quite regularly.

&gt; Considering Republicans have gerrymandered the important states to hell and back their red assemblies will just decided to send their electoral votes to Republicans even if the state voted blue and turn the US into a 1 party state.

Gerrymandering is generally bad, yes. This does not mean that the US is going to turn into a one-party state anytime soon. Again, you are making hyperbolic claims that are just not grounded in reality.

&gt; It's obvious that the Republican Party are the source of all the nations problems

You have not actually demonstrated this at all. That is an unnuanced, knee-jerk position to hold.

&gt; we can't ever get proven to work European social programs because they screech about ""muh taxes"" and ""muh entitlement"" because God forbid Bob making $100,000,000 a year and who has 10 Ferraris in the garage pay $0.01 extra in tax, and passing even the most basic and necessary regulation is pretty much impossible with them around. 

This is a laughably reductionist take on why the US can't implement a European-style system. I'd encourage you to watch [this video](https://youtu.be/VZx-rLoV4do), it does a fairly good job of explaining why.

&gt; I believe Republicans are the cause of the US's decline.

Philosophically, sure. It's very nuanced. 

But presumably your post is related to abortion. And if we want to pass legislation based on the concept of personhood, then we need *some* objective standard for it.

Housing through rent  is no longer possible at the 1/3 of earnings mark in most cities for rent, good luck buying when the house prices are outlandish.

Abortion becoming a state issue becomes a problem when states criminalize crossing the border to enjoy a service across state lines. Remember those Texas bounties they had on women who got an abortion out of state. 

The halt on min wage doesn’t only extend to housing becoming too expensive. The prices at McDonald’s are $11 for a meal, that’s more than most states have for minimum wage. The lowest denominator should be able to eat at McDonald’s 3x a day without issue. At 7.25 at 30 hours a week (because more means giving benefits), and when it takes 1.5 hours to earn a meal, 4.5 hours every day for those 3 meals, you’d need to work 31.5 hours a week of the 30 you get just to eat McDonald’s every day. And good luck getting another job when your schedule changes week by week. 

Our schools are overpriced. Unlimited demand because loans for 60k/year are approved. Are you kidding me? Make these loans dischargeable, so it’d force the banks take some actual responsibility on finding credible lenders instead of every idiot after highschool. The only reason the school prices are that high is because both parties absolved banks from any risk and allowed people who frankly shouldn’t be in college to be in college. 

Job market saturation. Too many people are underpaid like I discussed above leading to everyone funneling into “safe” jobs where there’s too many lawyers, biologists, psychologists. This artificially makes too many low quality employees and good employees massively underpaid, all vying for the spots at the top where they don’t have to struggle.
