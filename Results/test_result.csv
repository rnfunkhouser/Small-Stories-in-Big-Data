ieidegf,Kondrias,"Any type of training and mental refocusing of peoplesis brainwashing. Going to school to be a doctor with the intent to be able to do whatever you want to people and push your alternative medicine., and they are having you take courses about the ethics and compassion to patients and using evidence based methodology to care for people because your goal is to give them the best possible result. And you eventually give up your alternative crystal treatment beliefs and then begin fighting back HARD against those alternative treatments. That is brainwashing: the process of pressuring someone into adopting radically different beliefs by using systematic and often forcible means. It doesnt have to be forceful. But an academic curriculum is systematic. And the education pressured you into adopting radical different beliefs in order for you to pass. 

Basically brainwashing can be applied to a TON of things as a term. It is all just a matter of degrees. And it is not inherently something heinous or evil. 

If you consider humans to hold no value or right to life and have no problem killing. But are put through a process to systematically show you that, hey, that isnt okay or compassionate or considerate and here are all the problems why and it is done to you even semi-forcefully. To consider that, you shouldnt slit peoples throats. I dont think people would consider that to be a bad thing. A rehabilitative program in prison is brainwashing. Making you believe, you should NOT steal and harm other people. 

For example, In this instance of military, i would say they trained/conditioned/brainwashed you to be loyal to the military, be effective and capable at following orders from commanding officers, but also possess a level of agency and capacity to be capable of acting independently to not perpetuate failures through a system. (Effective chains or command etc.). There is Probably a better way to phrase it. The skills and things they teach and train you in when they are working to make someone into the most effective individual for the tasks they will need to accomplish. Which can involve developing new mindsets and habits and beliefs. Which is not inherently bad, is brain washing. 

I mean shit, someone working at Disneyland is getting brainwashed being there, buying into all things disney and disney stuff and disney products and merch and the whole cult of personality around it.

ieiygec,AnythingApplied,"Your inability to change someone's view that isn't open or interested in changing their view isn't a problem of being taught the wrong persuasion skills.  Even if high school debate, your objective isn't to change the perspective of the person you're debating against, which is often futile, its to persuade the audience.  And if the upvotes in those comment chains are any indicator, you won the audience.

Changing someone's perspective online as a faceless and anonymous commenter is just such an insurmountable task.  Even with everything going for you from being right to being articulate, you just don't have the trust to change any but the most open minds.

Plus, most of what you're citing aren't debates at all.  They are people taking to the internet to rant, or confirm their beliefs, or troll.  Its like complaining, ""I interjected myself into an echo chamber and nobody listened to my points""... Of course not.  As an anonymous faceless commenter you simply don't have the power to force people to actually engage with your ideas.  Even if the specific person you're debating is reading your comments thoroughly enough to take pot shots at any flaws they can find, it doesn't mean the rest of the audience will.

Put it this way. This argument is like saying ""the skills you learn running track aren't useful because people don't run that way in real life"". Apply this logic to swimming, cycling, boxing, etc and you'll understand that you can't devalue a formal, structured contest simply because there are informal or alternative versions of that activity that work differently.",7/1/22 18:32,7/1/22 18:32
ieiyz60,Tnspieler1012,"1. I believe it's been widely observed (as in this [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolved_(film)) ) that the norms of high school policy is not at all designed with the intention of mirroring the type of discourse norms/debates one should expect to encounter in public life. Rather, it's intended to cultivate inherently valuable patterns of valid reasoning and argument assessment that helps the student to more critically evaluate arguments for themselves, while also providing them with some public speaking skills. Moreover, Patricia Roberts-Miller, while discussing argumentation education more broadly, also makes the point that we teach students more idealized forms of reasoning not because we expect that this idealized world awaits our students, but so that students will demand that their elected representatives emulate these norms of reasoning and argumentation. Establishing an unachievable ideal (see Habermas's ""Ideal speech situation"") is then a means to helping people to identify when and how people are using faulty or unethical arguments or persuasive appeals.

I would agree that supplementing this normative focus with more diversified knowledge of how deliberation occurs across contexts and communities is crucial to helping one adapt to new audiences or figure out to proceed in messier argumentative situations. However, this doesn't signal an inherent fault in the taught norms themselves.

2. I take issue with your characterization of many of your examples as ""debate"". Lying for political purposes, or bad faith gish-galloping for example, are only operating within a debate in a very loose sense. A broader education in rhetoric broadly construed, may better account for how this language operates than thinking of these as part of a traditional argument genre like debate.

3. I'm curious what you mean by ""**lose**...debates"" in your final set of examples. First, because I would be careful of characterizing most argumentative situations as win/lose agonistic encounters. As I suggested before, I don't think high school debate ever claimed to be the ideal approach to all situations where disagreement is present (see Douglas Walton's list of types of dialogue). The general goal of most arguments should be knowledge-sharing and critique in which all interlocutors benefit (see Daniel H. Cohen's [tedx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTN9Nx8VYtk&amp;t=373s)).

Second, it seems like you didn't lose, so much as you reached an impasse with with people who had different epistemic foundations than yourself. That's fine. Sometimes you can then move into a discussion about epistemology/authority etc., but very often the means to persuasion are simply not available with those people, so you just have to call it a day. In those cases, debate hasn't failed, because debate wasn't entirely possible to begin with. Not everyone can be persuaded in a one-off encounter.

I will go so far as to say I think curricula and education can do much more to prepare students to better address the epistemic foundations for their reasoning, rather than assuming that everyone accepts, for example, scientific institutions. However, I think this is less a failure of things like high school debate instruction than a sign that they see their goal as prepping students to either engage in academic and juridical contexts or to make their representatives more accountable, than to dissuade their neighbors of conspiracy theories.",7/1/22 18:34,7/1/22 18:34
ieize7i,LucidLeviathan,"1) I'm a lawyer. Those techniques are useful in court. In court, judges don't let you get away with a lot of the ""dirty"" tactics that you describe. While oral arguments and hearings are an extremely formalized setting, they are still vitally important. 

2) The defense to a strawman or red herring is to point out the truth. This is easier done in in-person arguments. Unfortunately, most of our political discourse today is done through the media, which is committed to ""both-sides-ing"" everything. The problem is that the arbiter is not truly neutral in this debate. The only way to reduce strawmanning in politics is to reform the media. I'm not sure what that looks like. 

3) The discussion about the other rights that could be potentially lost with the *Dobbs* decision is *not* a slippery slope argument. Slippery slope arguments require that the warned dangers are not the direct logical outcome of something. In this case, with Justice Thomas broadcasting the intent to revisit decisions, it is no longer a mere slippery slope. It is a stated intention that they are criticizing. 

4) The Gish Gallop is a relatively new debate tactic, so ideal defenses haven't yet been defined.  Online, you can do it by breaking up and rebutting every single point with every single reply. That's what I do most often on here and why practically every post I make on CMV has numbered paragraphs. In person, you have to be assertive and insist that your opponent give you time to respond to one thing at a time. You will have to be rude. You will probably have to talk over them. Once somebody starts with the full-on verbal gish gallop talking over you, it is unlikely that their mind will be changed, so really, you are speaking to the audience, not to that person at that point. 

5) When somebody comes to a discussion unwilling to have their mind changed, it's not really a debate. It's not really even an argument. It's two people talking past each other. Conspiratorial thinkers cannot usually be reasoned with because they discount shared reality. In any argument, you have to have a certain number of shared axioms. You usually don't have those with conspiracists. You didn't lose that debate because there was no real debate. The same goes for your climate denial argument.

6) I'm a pretty new mod to CMV. I've been learning a lot in the last few weeks about why our rules are structured as they are. We have extensive rules in this sub to ensure actually productive debate. That means that, at least here, you can learn some pretty effective ways of persuading people. Good debate happens when two opposing parties enter with good faith and with a shared set of views about what is and isn't fair game. This sub strives to do that. (Note: We also have a rule where we don't moderate threads we discuss things in, so don't take any inaction on my part as an endorsement or opposition to a post.)",7/1/22 18:38,7/1/22 18:38

iek62dk,carbonetc,"&gt; I've also personally managed to lose several debates thanks to bad faith tactics.

&gt; some people can use bad faith tactics to win.

You keep talking about winners and losers. How do you determine that you've ""lost"" a debate? What is the criteria? Does a guy in a black and white striped shirt walk in an blow a whistle? Discourse isn't a sport. To approach it as one seems to me to be a perversion and debasement of discourse. I don't know the extent to which high schools treat their debate programs like sport (I haven't watched or participated, personally) and I can see the value of the format as a learning exercise, but I hope they're clear that what they're having students do is still a big departure from discourse.

Here's maybe a better heuristic to go by for whether you've ""won"" a conversation. If people who are highly educated in the subject, honest, operating in good faith, etc. think that you presented your case in a rigorous, fair, and accurate way, you've won. Note that your counterpart can also have won if they've achieved the same. And note that you've still won even if you've convinced no one. If you're operating in bad faith, using underhanded rhetorical tactics that you would hypocritically object to if they were used on you, trying to win points with gotchas, deploying obvious logical fallacies, etc. you've lost. Note that your counterpart can also have lost if they've done the same. And note that they've still lost even if they've convinced everyone.

You'll probably call this idealistic, but I'd call it the only thing deserving of being called discourse. If you're in it to ""win"" rather than to have accumulated and expressed deep understanding of something, then I'd say you're more concerned about power than about truth. That's not discourse. That's combat. If what you want to play at is combat, that's fine, just know that it's a different kind of activity. Politics is rarely ever discourse; politics is combat in a poorly-made discourse costume. We need to always make room in the world for pure discourse to also exist, because there will never be any shortage of combat. Discourse doesn't need to be ""fixed"" by lowering it into the mud. You're correct that in combat you're lucky if there are any rules of engagement at all. Agreeing to rules and then breaking them is just another valid tool in the toolbox where combat is concerned, because combat is about power.

I take it that you value discourse and want to be involved in discourse, but other people are dragging you into combat. I'm not sure it even makes sense to think in terms of winners and losers when two people are not even playing the same game.

Th GOP isn't the *cause* of the decline. The GOP is merely a tool. It's a tool for dark money and incredibly wealthy people with nefarious goals (such as preventing action on climate change) to amp up social issues so that they can take advantage of the inherent weakness of the American electoral system, which is that our democratic republic gives extremely disproportionate voice to the least educated, most gullible subset of the population (rural voters).

I know there are some true believers in the ranks of the GOP who are absolutely, unabashedly stupid but many of them are just straight up lying. Mitch McConnel, Ted Cruz, and Newt Gingrich (might need to wiki this guy depending on your age but he was instrumental in creating the current adversarial political landscape) are clearly very intelligent individuals but they are just trying to make a buck and ensure their compatriots can continue making bucks to the detriment of the rest of society for decades to come.

I think you are asking a bit much from a stigma. Even if there is some vanishing minority of incestuous relationships which are harmless it is too nuanced a view for stigma.

A stigma is inherently a generalization. If 99% of something has a certain negative trait they all will gain a stigma for the negative thing.

But the things you are leaving out to pin this on one political party as the primary source are telling. I scrolled through all the comments and didn’t see a single mention of COVID.

What about outsourcing jobs? What about foreign actors poisoning our social media discourse? You could say Republicans’ response to these things haven’t been ideal, but not that they caused these things or that total Democrat control would’ve resulted in perfect solutions to these issues.

Any phenomenon as large as “the global hegemonic power of the last half century is in decline” has thousands of causal factors. Republicans bad is just one of those.

This does not match up with your statement about Republicans being Fascist because 1. This is *less* government control and 2. Fascist environmental policy was radically different than Republicans based on which country you were in. You should see what Nazi Animal Welfare laws were like.

Also about calling Republicans Fascist. This shows you don't know what Fascism is. Fascism regulates buisiness a lot more. It centers around an economic theory that rejects capitalism and socialism for class collaboration/corporatism (which is not big business controlling everything. That's corporatocracy. Corporatism forces buisiness to negotiate with labor. (Just a Warning: You're talking to someone who will use things like Doctrine of Fascism as sources if you try to argue this.) Decreasing regulation also is literally the opposite of any form of Fascism.

Now another point I need to point out:

If you read the constitution, Republicans are looking specifically what it says on the paper. They aren't caring about your feelings. Roe v Wade was overturned because it was legislating from the bench, which means you have a group of people appointed for life making the Rules. Democrats had decades to codify it into law but did nothing. If you want someone to blame, blame both sides since one side

So on to the decline

You defined it has reduction in quality of life. Find a place in the country, red or blue, that has not had reductions in the quality of life. Costs of living are skyrocketing. Gas prices are climbing. The homeless situation in some cities are out of hand. So is it necessarily Republicans fault or do both sides sit on their asses and blame the opposition?

Democrats with their affordable healthcare? Yeah you can qualify if you are so poor you can't eat and your quality of life is already shit. Throwing a bone to the poor for votes

Republicans standing around offering no solutions besides blaming Democrats? Sitting around doing nothing.

Why don't you blame all the senile, old politicians and the two party system? The reason America is like this: New ideas and third parties that actually bring alternate solutions are opposed to hell and back by the establishment so nothing gets done.

It is entirely possible people have been raised to provide a specific response to specific subjects without having ever been exposed to it.

It’s a similar phenomenon to homosexuals that are raised to hate homosexuality in religious/regressive areas, and they go so much of their life never really realizing their own sexuality, or hating themselves for the thoughts they may have when looking at members of the same sex. 

However, these same people when exposed to porn would _certainly_ end up gravitating towards homosexual porn. Even though they would have responded on the survey that it disgusts them.

It is entirely possible that this result here:

iell1kq,Crayshack,"I'm going to address Star Wars in particular.  In part because I'm very familiar with the fandom and in part, because I've written a rather lengthy article explaining the [difficulty in unifying the Star Wars fandom](https://crayshack.com/2021/07/07/star-wars-a-fandom-divided-against-itself/).

To summarize, Star Wars was fairly diverse in how the original film approached genres.  It was a blending of a large number of different genres that were all combined together in a unique fashion.  This was a big part of the initial success.  Fans of those various genres were all drawn in and felt as though they were getting a fresh entry in their genre.  This is a big part of why the original film was such a blockbuster smash hit.

The issue comes from later entries.  Because different groups of people had different aspects of the original film that drew them in and that they enjoyed, different groups of fans had different aspects they wanted to see later works explore in more detail.  The problem is that in some respects, to explore one aspect further means to neglect another.  So fans began getting upset when various details of Star Wars pulled away from what they saw as a core aspect of why they enjoyed the franchise in the first place.  

This wasn't helped by periods of time where Star Wars existed only as niche productions allowing different parts of the fanbase to focus just on the parts they liked.  When Star Wars returned to attempting big-budget blockbusters that attempted to recapture the magic of the original film, they found that the fanbase had diversified too much.  So, now the franchise is caught in a pickle where pretty much anything they release will be disliked by at least some of the fans.

TL;DR: Star Wars lacks a consistent theme present throughout the franchise as a whole so there are few people who actually enjoy the *whole* franchise and most people only actually like parts of it while disliking parts that follow other styles.",7/2/22 10:27,7/2/22 10:27

But progressives are less concerned with race than with character. That's why they're willing to smear Clarence Thomas while praising Joe Biden. 

Conservatives are the same way. They praise Thomas and smear Biden. This is because there are actual, political, ideological differences between the parties. 

For there to be compromise, the Democrats and Republicans must begin agreeing with each other on the meta or procedural level. Case in point: Democratic-appointed and elected prosecutors are saying that they will not prosecute women who get abortions even if doing so is nominally against the law. Others are declining to prosecute shoplifters. This is a road that we do not want to go down. What stops Republican prosecutors from refusing to prosecute wage theft? Environmental violations? Tax evasion?

Polling has revealed that most of the GOP are not watching the Jan 6 Hearings. They don't *want* to be confronted with what actually happened. Their only solace lies in sticking their heads in the sand and pretending it didn't happen, or that it was Antifa, or something else.

The lengths that the modern GOP (voter) is going through to protect themselves from the reality of 06 Jan serves as a strong argument that an open call to violence would lose popular support with the larger base.

ielx97f,DeepMess9,"I think you overestimate the average American's willingness to participate in anarchy. Our lives are extremely comfortable compared to that of our predecessors; even the poorest in the US have access to stuff like toilets with running water and microwaves,  which is far more luxurious than what was available during the Civil War. So yes, even if the political division in the US is comparable to that of before the Civil War, society at large is not. Most people are not psychologically capable of giving up Facebook; what makes you think they'd be willing to slum it in a milita? 

On a similar note, you describe this conflict being between the two major political parties; Republicans and Democrats. Lemme break down for you why you'll never see Dems and Reps actually fighting it out. 

i. Most Americans are not gun owners. Most Americans are very, very uncomfortable with guns, as well as violence in general. I do not think most Americans would be willing/able to participate in major violence. Yes, there are Conservatives who are clearly eager to based on Jan 6, but in that case it isn't a fight between political factions. It's a fight against a group of terrorists and law enforcement. 

ii. There are more Dems in the US than Reps. At least 50% of Reps are over the age of 50. I can only imagine how many of those people have mobility issues, diabetes, heart disease, etc. I seriously doubt all the Meemaws and Peepaws are gonna wheel onto the battlefield, machine gun in hand, ready to fuck up the Liberals. Again, there are able-bodied people who are willing to get violent, but not enough for a war, or even widespread rioting. 

iii. On a similar note, most people are not actually loyal to the DNC/RNC anymore. In reality, most Americans are moderates, and most Americans generally dislike career politicians. It just *seems* like people are super partisan because the DNC/RNC are very good at maintaing control. 

iii. Lastly, conflict comparable to that of the Civil War requires a lot of time, effort, organization, and money. The middle class is overworked and underpayed. We are tired and poor, regardless of political affiliation (Reps are also much poorer than Dems). I think we will continue to post about it on the internet, and some of us will organize to protest or whatever, but that's about it.",7/2/22 11:57,7/2/22 11:57
ielzx3b,MutinyIPO,"Going death by death feels impossibly crude, it’s just that I’m sick of seeing this “40+ deaths” stat, which is at best misleading and at worst active disinformation. 

First off, the *broadest* possible definition of deaths tied to the BLM unrest results in 19 deaths total, which isn’t nothing! But it’s not 40, and even then when you scrutinize these incidents they don’t appear to have much to do with BLM at all:

-May 27: Two people killed in Minneapolis during a pawn shop robbery happening under the cover of greater civil unrest

May 29: a protestor in Detroit was shot by someone in a vehicle outside the protest

May 29: Oakland CA, a security guard was killed in a drive-by shooting happening concurrently to the protests, though with no apparent connection to the protests themselves 

May 30: St Louis MO, a man robbing a FedEx truck was ran over by that truck (again, happening concurrently with protests, but with no clear link to the protest itself)

May 30: Omaha NE, a protestor was shot and killed by a bar owner afraid the protestors would threaten his property, although they had not done so

May 31: Kansas City MO, a man is shot and killed during a car robbery happening concurrently with the protests (are you noticing a pattern here?)

May 31: Chicago IL, a man is shot and killed during a convenience store robbery

June 1: Indianapolis IL, two people were shot and killed by a gunman, and I literally can’t find any more details than that

June 1: Louisville KY, a restaurant owner is shot and killed by the Louisville police after they violently enforced curfew at a neighborhood gathering, and someone lost in the chaos fired a shot. 

For the above incident, it’s unclear who fired what when, but hours after the incident, the Police chief was fired with cause. This strongly suggests the police were the aggressors. 

June 1: Davenport IA, a protestor is attacked and killed on her way home

June 1, Davenport IA, a man is shot and killed after shooting at an unmarked police van. This is perhaps the only incident that fits the moral panic narrative, and even then 1. The person who was killed was the one who attacked police, not an officer and 2. Once again, there is no clear link to BLM, it’s a concurrent event 

June 1, Cicero IL, two men are shot and killed during a liquor store looting/robbery. 

June 1, Las Vegas NV, a concealed carrying man in a “rowdy” gathering is shot at by a police officer, he returns fire, flees and is eventually shot dead by police

June 2: Philadelphia PA, across the city, two different men are killed while trying to rob stores 

June 2: St Louis MO, this is the famous David Dorn case. I’m not gonna lie, it’s horrifying. There is still no apparent connection to BPM. 

June 2: Vallejo CA, an unarmed man is shot and killed by police while kneeling

June 3: Bakersfield CA, a protestor is run over by a car

June 20: Seattle, WA, someone sleeping in CHAZ is shot and killed. Unclear circumstances leading up to the incident, although we know that other CHAZ residents rushed the victim to the ER directly after they were shot. 

June 29: Seattle WA, another CHOP/CHAZ shooting, again extremely unclear what happened 

July 4: Seattle WA, a protestor is murdered in a hit and run on the highway 

July 5: Indianapolis IN, a woman is killed during a drunken brawl that was apparently triggered when she said “All Lives Matter”. This is kinda-sorta a BLM link, but not *really*. Like - bar brawls tend to happen over absolutely random shit, especially when someone says something inflammatory. The incident is still tragic of course, it’s just that yet again the connection to protests here is tenuous at best. 

July 25: Austin TX, a protestor is run over in an apparent hit and run

August 29, Portland OR - yet another highly publicized incident, in which an anti fascist assassinated a member of a far-right militia. Probably one of the two incidents that fits the broad criteria. He was killed by US Marshals shortly thereafter. 

So as you can see, there was precisely one verifiable incident of a politically-motivated killing, and it happened after the protests/riots had been raging for months. The FAR more reliable patterns here were 1. *BLM protestors* getting killed and 2. Burglars using the protests as cover to do their thing",7/2/22 12:17,7/2/22 12:17
iem2b2b,EarballsOfMemeland,"&gt; However, Defund the Police wasn't around in 2016 when Trump got elected. At the time, the biggest buzzword on the left was ""privilege."" Specifically, ""White Privilege"" and ""Male Privilege.""

&gt; These are horrible terms. Arguably the worst terms that you could have chosen to convey the meaning, for many reasons. First of all, the word ""privilege"" has historically been assigned to rich kids that have never had to work a day in their life. Who are completely out of touch with the real world because they've never had to participate in the real world. It has, historically, been a pejorative.

&gt; Assigning this term to the inherent advantages that some men and white people receive based on their skin color or gender was a huge marketing mistake. It automatically puts those groups on the defensive. They feel like people using those terms think that they've had an easy life of abundance and have never worked for a thing they've gotten. That what little they've managed to build was handed to them instead of earned.

Well by your own definition of the term privilege, the term is being used correctly in both White privilege and Male privilege. If a wealthy person is privileged because they have never had to work a day in their lives, ie walked in the shoes of those who have to say work on factory floors or dead end 9-5's, then a white person has never had to live as a POC, or a man never having to live as a woman and deal with women's issues (with the exception of men who have transitioned). If using correct terminology upsets people to the point of radicalisation then I'm not sure what to say. 

&gt; Pop Culture and Hollywood

Again, if Ghostbusters and Star Wars radicalise moderate men, I doubt they were that moderate. This section reeks of cherry picking, for every movie you mentioned as being overly feminist there's half a dozen more with stereotypically manly men do manly men things. Movies like Ghostbusters were cherry picked intentionally pushed by the right as part of the culture war. And it's not like men as a villain is new, it's been going on since the dawn of cinema. Was the original Star Wars trilogy pushing an anti-male, anti-white narrative? Or how about Death Wish, Commando, Die Hard any number of movies. Of course not, because figures on the right want to push the culture war.

&gt; Dismissal of Men's Issues.

Some of these points are valid. Yes, men's issues like high suicide rates absolutely deserve attention. But: 

&gt; However, when men tried to bring up these issues, they were basically told to shut up and sit down.

By other men and by people who valued traditional masculinity. Not the left. You're saying that moderate men were radicalised in to supporting the parties that create the environments that support the Moderate Men's own oppression. I do agree with some other points here, yes there is a level of hypocrisy in body positivity, but again, the right does not even claim to try to make things better for men. They will say ""Well since men can still be made fun of for our bodies, we're not going to subscribe to any sort of boy positivity"", when obviously the better way of thinking is to fight for body positivity among men too. 

&gt; Tinder and Dating

This section really doesn't seem attached to reality. Millions of men across the world don't have trouble finding partners. If some do, it's on them, not society or women, or whatever else. We're seeing a rise of red pill groups because people don't like being told that things are their fault, and grifters, of both monetary and political varieties, caught on to that and preyed upon those they saw as vulnerable. The Taliban also use the promise of women in addition to money to recruit new fighters. Are they Left wing?",7/2/22 12:36,7/2/22 12:36

iem3slt,lydiansharp1,"I'm gonna address the men's rights stuff, seeing as how I'm a man who somehow magically isn't being ""pushed to the right"".

&gt; Men's issues have always existed, from suicide rates, to bias in the justice system and family courts. However, when men tried to bring up these issues, they were basically told to shut up and sit down.

I haven't seen this. I've seen men try to *shut down* feminists asking for equal rights by saying ""but what about these issues that affect men???""

What I have also seen is that men who talk about their mental health issues, about feeling depressed, about just basically having emotions, tend to get shut down *by other men*, especially by conservatives. Example: I'm FTM, and there's this ""running joke"" with my conservative family members that whenever I show any sort of emotion that's proof that I'm really a woman. The left-wing people I interact with never say anything like that.

&gt; Then social media started allowing some hate speech, but not others. Hate speech directed at men or white people was blatantly allowed, while saying the same thing about women or POC would get you immediately banned. ""Kill All Men,"" ""Male Tears,"" etc, etc. Change those terms into any other demographic, and that would be hate speech.

Weird, because every time I've seen someone say ""kill all men"" on social media it gets taken down super fast.

&gt; When men spike out about these things, they were again told to go eff themselves. Even this very site did similar things. r/twoxchromosomes spews just as vile things about men as r/mra spewed about women. One was removed from the platform, the other is still alive and well today.

Literally what vile things are being spewed on r/twoxchromosomes? I'm looking at it right now and it's mostly people talking about abortion rights and violence against women. Linked examples would be appreciated.

&gt; Body positivity is another example. Women were 'all beautiful' no matter their size, while men were still openly mocked for everything from their height, penis size, or weight.

No, that's not cool.

So what are you doing about it? Are you just sitting there expecting women to start some kind of All Men Are Beautiful movement? Or are you calling out the people who say gross things like that? (It's both men and women who do that shit, in my own experience.)

Just a little protip, the main impediment of the male body positivity movement that I've personally witnessed has been the people who hijack it to whine about how women have it so much easier. And that tends to be the problem with most pro-men movements. Like, quit talking about women if what you really want to do is promote men's issues!

&gt; Articles started popping up online about ""Men are going to college less, and women are the most affected."" Basically saying that undereducated men was actually a women's issue because that meant less eligible men for women to date.

iemrf39,distractonaut,"Ok so first of all, I'm not autistic but I work as a speech therapist &amp; behaviour therapist at an autism-specific organisation. So, I'll share some of the reasons I've heard from people in the autistic community about why they don't like the term. I don't necessarily want to change your personal feelings about the term (you do you) but will just share some perspective.


1. I think a lot of people don't interpret the term 'highly functioning' to mean 'a highly functioning member of society',  but more 'highly functioning... for an autistic person'. So, the default expectation is that they *wouldn't* be 'functioning' well, so you need to label it if the person can actually live independently, have a job etc. I can see how this could be considered offensive, in a similar way to how describing a Black person as ['articulate'](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theroot.com/he-s-so-articulate-what-that-really-means-1790874985/amp) might be considered offensive.


2. Some of what you've described around studying facial expressions and learning to socialise - I have heard this be described as [masking](https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/autism-masking#definition) which some in the community feel is kind of artificially forcing themselves to 'conform' to neurotypical expectations. I've read and heard a lot of perspectives of autistic people saying that they feel like they have to 'hide' their true selves to be accepted, and sometimes even to avoid discrimination or bullying.


3. The main reason we've stopped using the terms 'high functioning' and 'low functioning' at my organisation is that it really doesn't help much in terms of actually describing the person, their strengths and challenges. If someone is described as 'high functioning', people might assume that they don't ever struggle or need any supports when actuality they might be working really hard and under a lot of stress all the time. Or, be able to live and work independently but still struggle with social cues or sensory regulation. And 'low functioning' might invite people to assume the person can't ever learn independent skills or be a functioning member of society, when really they just haven't been offered the right type of supports yet.",7/2/22 15:52,7/2/22 15:52
iemtkbq,Guy_with_Numbers,"&gt; My reasoning for taking this stance is that I have manually learned all I know about socializing, something most people learn naturally while growing up. I've studied the people around me extensively, watched media (both fictional and reality) for hours on end to recognize patterns in speech and socializing. I've actively listened in on, and participated in conversations throughout my life, even though the most common reaction the first ten years was the others leaving because of something I said/didn't say or because I looked bored/uninterested. I've studied facial movements, expressions, and have had to manually manufacture my own expressions of varying emotions. At this point it's 85% automatic since I've been doing it for so long. However, I feel like becoming a ""Highly Functioning"" member of society is something we should all strive for, and therefore I am proud that I am classified as one considering the inherent disadvantages that stand in my way of doing just that.

I think you're following a somewhat different idea of ""high functioning"" than what that term entails. [The ""high functioning""](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/high-functioning-autism) is relative to someone with more severe symptoms of autism. That isn't something that we all have to strive for, because non-autistic people are the ""fully functioning"" benchmark already. That isn't even necessarily something that *can* be striven for either, as not all autism symptoms can be mitigated to such an extent through personal effort.

In addition, while your pride in mitigating your symptoms through your effort is entirely valid, that is something highly specific to you. Other people may see things differently. If I see someone with amputated legs swimming and I say, ""You're a pretty good swimmer for a legless dude"", some will see it as a compliment directed at their skill, and others will see it as a reminder of their shortcoming and how their achievements are qualified by that shortcoming. Likewise, you see the term as praise for your efforts, but others may see it as a reminder that they are not ""normal"".

Given that the positive connotation in both those scenarios (good swimmer/good social skills) can be conveyed without using a term that can potentially be perceived negatively (amputee/autistic), I'd say ""high functioning autist"" isn't a flattering term.",7/2/22 16:09,7/2/22 16:09
iemytgv,budlejari,"High functioning is not used when comparing autistic people to neurotypical people. It's always used as a comparison to 'low functioning' people. The 'stereotypical' autistic person. 

And high functioning is bad as a label because it does not convey what 'high functioning' means. Someone can be perfectly capable of sustaining something like a job, get home, and literally be unable to function because they are so overwhelmed and distressed by masking all day that they need help to do basic tasks like having a shower. They have to sleep to get over it, they have severe gastro issues because anxiety over masking, and they're unable to indulge in their passions because they're worried about coming across as abnormal. But they live in their own home, they pay taxes, and their boss thinks that they are 'normal' because they don't need to stim at work and they look normal enough to pass under the radar.

Someone else can headbang to self soothe, wear ear defenders when they go out because the world is too loud, and pathologically loathe metal cutlery so they'll only eat with plastic or their hands, but they're also capable of beautiful art and reading university level books on art theory. They don't work but they use their benefits to collect lego model kits that bring them immense joy and they're part of a regular Warhammer club that their dad drives them to twice a month. They have online friends, they do some side painting for their friend, and they're very happy in their own world. 

Which person is 'high functioning'? Which person deserves the label, if any? Does the fact that one person have a job mean they're 'higher functioning' than the other, even though it leaves them absolutely wrecked? The other person is on benefits, wears ear defenders in public, and can't stomach eating in a restaurant but they're  thriving in their own world, to their own standards, and they don't feel like they're missing out. 

Using labels like high functioning also diminished the idea of someone being autistic - it's suggesting that someone is so close as to be just like one of the 'normal people' so perhaps they don't need as much help or leeway as someone who is not at at that point or who chooses to *not* engage with society as a 'normal' person. Those people who use it as a term often use it as an excuse to disregard the autistic experience in the world and to assert the idea of there being different 'levels' of disabled and if you're not a particular way, you're not entitled to a kindness and tolerance for your disability because you are somehow *choosing* to not fit in. 

Low functioning implies that someone has 'failed to achieve' or that they are somehow lacking. It's often used to indicate someone who is profoundly disabled or who has a disability that is socially 'unacceptable'. They're not just 'weird' but in a quirky cool way, they are definitely Disabled with a capital D. Part of the difficulty with having children and adults with disability is that both they and their parents can be sensitive to the idea of 'not succeeding' being innate. It's easy to write off these people as 'not going to make it' by both professionals and parents, and those people can be disadvantaged by the idea that they're 'low functioning'. Just because they may not achieve total independence and will need support does not mean they will never do things on their own, have vibrant and passionate interests, or be an active part of a community, their family, and a wider society. Professionals and parents need to work together to understand the situation and to have reasonable expectations but assigning someone as low functioning effectively says, ""not going to thrive and achieve - don't even try."" 

Autism is not a one size fits all diagnosis. It's not a universal experience. Someone can have little difficulty in one aspect of their life but immense difficulty in another, and their level of need can fluctuate day to day, even year to year, or person to person. Putting people in boxes based on what they are 'percieved' to be capable of by using terms like high and low functioning does a disservice to everybody around them and the person themselves.",7/2/22 16:51,7/2/22 16:51

You want a real mental workout? (This will only work if you're  introspective and a little bit argumentative, but it sounds like you are both). Get with someone who holds the SAME views as you. Hearing your own ideas in someone else's mouth can cause you to think about them differently.  
""Do I really sound like that when I say X?"" 
""They're not actually justifying X very well. Can I justify X?"" 
Or even ""Dang! That's a good point! Why didn't I think of that to justify X?"" 

Sometimes hearing our own opinions echoed back to us makes us question those opinions; sometimes it gives us a deeper understanding of them. Either way, though, you're thinking, which is the goal.

ieoxt24,Scarecrow1779,"Your mindset reminds me of my own when I first got out of college. You assume all views are relatively equal in value and seek to moderate between them. Basically, you're saying, ""can't we all just get along?"" I maintained that approach through the 2016 election, and seeing the cascading results has absolutely disabused me of that world view.

The problem is, not all views are created equal. Some are held in good faith, while others are not. Some views are based on careful consideration, and some are not. Some people are willing to change their views based on discussion and new evidence, some are not. Some views may be misguided attempts to help others, while some views exist only for the purpose of selfishness at the expense of others. 

There is a common thread that ties together all of the negative aspects I just listed. They are fueled by a lack of empathy, respect, or consideration for others and perpetuated by a lack of critical thought or willingness to consider other views. Notice I did not say lack of *exposure* to other views, I said lack of willingness to consider. This doesn't have to mean that a person is inherently bad in their soul, per se. This can be driven by the opinions of those that surround them, the media they consume, etc. Specifically, the propaganda of Fox News and groups like it has been driven by fear, hate, lies, and dehumanization for decades, as a way to manipulate people for political and monetary gain. 

So, getting back around to my point: outside of politics and religion, views can often be discussed without vitriol and growth can happen organically. However, those two specific topics are where people are most often indoctrinated and manipulated by large groups to where the individual cannot consider other opinions. While at work, these topics can pushed into the background or ignored sometimes. However, in the context of a romantic partnership, there is no getting around or away from a person's political views, and they absolutely WILL effect the partnership when they are large differences in views. 

Think about all the things that couples have to consider together. Where will we live (so which state laws do we want to be subject to)? How do we raise potential children? How do we deal with medical issues such as unplanned pregnancy, planned pregnancy with complications, etc? How do we interact with friends of different races, beliefs, and orientations? If we have spare income, do we want to donate it to some charitable cause? Many of these things make politics inescapable and can deadlock normal conversations in a relationship if differences in views are too great.

So, the sum of all this is that some people's political opinions are too ingrained and negative to be ignored or worked around by their partners, and we have also shown many issues where a couple HAS to be in agreement for their relationship to continue. Therefore, it is reasonable to end or avoid beginning a relationship with somebody that has substantially different political beliefs than you.",7/3/22 6:02,7/3/22 6:02

iepg5cn,drogian,"Yes, but the first step to ""make [gifted programs] better"" isn't actually to build learning in a particular subject area.

Where I think gifted education fails is that serving a gifted student requires a two-step process:

* Reduce redundancy

* Provide opportunity

Education programs tend to skip step #1 and jump directly to step #2. But the mental health issues associated with giftedness tend to not be caused by a lack of opportunity to learn; gifted students (like many other students) will learn independently if the learning isn't forced in the classroom. The greatest need gifted students have is to not be browbeaten with busy work on a daily basis, leading to a sense of futility, purposelessness, and low self-esteem.

The first step in a gifted program should be to find ways to reduce redundancy the student faces. In a pull-out gifted program, this means that the gifted program needs to go into the regular classroom and reduce the amount of *work* the student is asked to complete to create and demonstrate learning in the regular classroom. As a second step, the gifted student can be presented with opportunities to learn that aren't just adding to a workload, which can include learning in small groups with similar peers--but this needs to be a second step (and sometimes similar-level peers don't exist).

This actually requires a paradigm shift. It's hard for people to realize that a good gifted program prioritizes *doing less*. But that's what's needed for gifted students. The first step is to empower those students to *do less*. The second step is to empower those students to use their newly-freed time to continue growing.

My point here is that, while you're right that gifted programs need to improve, the first step isn't to push students to develop additional learning in a particular subject area. The first step is to change the expectations for the students to respect what they've already learned. This provides what is sorely missing from many parts of the education system: respect for the student as an individual with unique needs.

The challenge is that many teachers of gifted students think they're respecting the student by treating the gifted student how the teacher would like to be treated in a classroom. The teacher confuses a *gifted* learner with a *mature* learner.

Most people who I've seen teach in gifted classrooms realize that the kids are smart, but actually underestimate how smart the kids truly are. People in general have a hard time realizing when someone is smarter than themselves, so it can be hard for a teacher of gifted students to realize that even though there is an age gap, the student is actually smarter than the teacher. This doesn't mean that the student already had content-area knowledge or understanding; the student being smarter than the teacher just means the student can pick up new ideas faster than the teacher can. But the teacher instead thinks the student is more mature than their peers.

Due to this disconnect, teachers in gifted environments often teach how they would like to be taught, with multiple repetitions in variously accessible contexts for diverse learning styles. But the kids don't need that; they can catch on more quickly.

So reduce redundancy.",7/3/22 8:30,7/3/22 8:30
iepi0u9,Manny_Kant,"&gt;If they are unable to be rehabilitated, that process simply doesn’t end during their natural life.

I think you're assuming many things without really appreciating their difficulty.  First, who determines when rehabilitation has succeeded?  There are plenty of examples of people [faking rehabilitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Kemper).  But there are also many examples going in the other direction, where people are kept long beyond what is appropriate, which is part of why we no longer have asylums.  

But there's a greater issue in the quoted text, and that's how to handle situations where the time called for pursuant to punishment is significantly different than the time needed for rehabilitation.  Let's say someone commits a minor violent crime, e.g., groping someone in public, because of a mental health disorder (most common reason for most crimes that happen in public, frankly).  Let's say that they have limited inhibition because of a serious but unmedicated schizotypal disorder.  This person has an intractable mental health condition that is unlikely to resolve in any significant way without medication, but they are also resistant to medication because it takes a significant toll on their perceived clarity of thought, and mood.  This person would usually be sentenced to some jail time, usually well under a year throughout the US, assuming it's charged as a misdemeanor.  But they are unlikely to be ""rehabilitated"" in that time, and any rehabilitation they experience is going to end as soon as they leave the facility and stop taking medication.  They may live to grope another day.

Under your suggestion, we would just keep this person in custody for the rest of their lives, right?  But this is where the ""justice"" system takes into account what is ""just"", which involves consideration of proportionality, irrespective of rehabilitation.  There needs to be a limit on punishments for certain crimes, which is why most crimes have statutory maximums, rather than extending to life across the board.  I think there's a value and wisdom in that, disconnected from any rehabilitative consideration, that you're not giving enough credit.

This is the pro-choice stance. This is all we need from people. Many pro choicers personally would not have an abortion, or think it would be a hard moral question for them (or others to grapple with). 

We just don't think the government gets to force you to make the decision they think is best. We think it should be up to the mother and their healthcare provider at least up to viability. 

&gt;But I do think that there are good reasons to consider it a very complex issue, and not nearly as black or white as most people seem to make it.

ieq314h,animatorgeek,"I think you're giving short shrift to the idea of bodily autonomy. In US law there is never ever a case where a person is required to sacrifice their body for the sake of another person. You have a rare blood type that will save someone's life? The state can't force you to donate blood.  Your minor child needs a kidney and you're the only viable donor? Not without your consent.

Even if we see a fetus as fully human with inalienable rights, to outlaw abortion is to give rights to that fetus that no other human has -- the right to use another person's body to stay alive. It's telling the mother that she doesn't have dominion over her own body, which is antithetical to fundamental principles of a free society. So outlawing abortion doesn't just make a fetus have equal rights to other humans -- it gives the fetus *special* rights that no one else has, to the potential detriment of its mother.

Honestly, that clinches the argument for me. It's not a complex moral issue, at least as far as how to write laws about it. The ability to end a pregnancy is a basic human right. Each pregnant person can make personal decisions about whether they feel it's right or wrong. It's not the state's place to make that decision for them. That's what ""pro choice"" means.

As far as ""we should talk about it more,"" I agree with what many others have said. The talking should be done between the pregnant person and their trusted confidants and medical providers. Philosophers and ethicists can keep talking about it all they want, but the morality question is clear.",7/3/22 11:10,7/3/22 11:10
ieq4x6p,Genoscythe_,"&gt;This is the most likely explanation for the lack of regulation in breeding that leads to an extinction of certain species. They lack the “gay/queer” gene as a mitigating measure so it’s absurdly easy for them to fall prey to their population growth outpacing the resources available.  


Except rats don't really ""go extinct"" as a species, either. Population clusters might boom and then starve, but afterwards there are usually enough survivors to be ready for the next boom. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I mean think about it, why haven’t humans or other mammals ever been in danger of overbreeding to the point of extinction? I bet the common element that prevents this overbreeding in the first place is that gay gene that developed in only certain species.  


For the same reasons why rats didn't.

 For thousands of years the average woman had a dozen kids, then most of those died from malnutrition and overcrowding-related illnesses before they could have their own dozen kids.  

After a few good harvests, our population immediately boomed because women were less starving and a bit more likely to stay alive through a pregnancy, then after a drought the population plummeted, but most of the time it just stagnated right at the rate that we were capable of sustaining. 

A small minority being gay, was a small blip on the radar compared to that. 

Family planning is a modern social invention, from a combination of effective birth control, feminism, and yes, openly living as gay is part of it too. 

It wasn't invented by evolution with a higher purpose, it is something that we had to invent ourselves. 

&gt;Why would it suddenly form in a DNA determined “XY” person then?

Because that's what genes do. Brothers and sisters inherit genes from the same parents, that form into different chromosomes. The same genes might end up having different physical outcomes in men and in women.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Because a neurological wiring isn’t a literal defect like a body plumbing issue is, it isn’t a deformity or a coding mistake on the part of the genetic formation, it’s just part of who the person is.

Your ""plumbing"" and your neurology can both be called ""defective"" if you want to make a value judgement about them, or be ""part of who you are"" if you want to be supportive. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Isn’t that just a genetic defect that causes a disease? Are you saying you believe non-heterosexual orientations are technically genetic defects?  


Sicle cell anemia is a defect because we don't like it, and homosexuality isn't a defect, because we do like it. There is no such thing as ""technically a genetic defect"", the difference between healthy and defective is a social construct. 

&gt;Well if that theory about it being related to or part of a gene that increases female fertility rings true then it probably continues to get propagated through her line.  


Yeah, but then we are back to the original tangent. If homosexuality was not designed by a conscious entity to ""keep the population in check"", but the random side effect of genes that increase fertility in some of their non-gay expressions, then there is no reason to assume that the Westermark effect wouldn't apply to them.",7/3/22 11:24,7/3/22 11:24

ieqvvlw,drogian,"Bodily autonomy in abortion and euthanasia aren't actually the same issue.

With regard to abortion, bodily autonomy means that the government cannot compel you to donate your body parts to support another individual. The government causes your body to be used for the benefit of another.

With regard to euthanasia, bodily autonomy means that the government can compel you to reduce harm to yourself. Your body is not being used for a person's benefit.

In both cases, the government is restricting what you can do with your body; but actively compelling you to donate your body to another is more invasive than preventing you from using your body as you see fit.

Someone who respects bodily autonomy with regard to euthanasia may also respect bodily autonomy with regard to drug use, seatbelt laws, public nudity, prostitution, etc. This is freedom to use your body as you wish so long as it doesn't interfere with others' abilities to use their bodies. This freedom extends to abortion under the understanding that a fetus has no right to life, while under the ""right to life"" view of abortion, this freedom doesn't extend to abortion, as abortion interferes with the fetus's body.

With abortion, the government is compelling you to provide life support to that fetus. You're compelled to donate your body parts to another individual. That's more extreme than not being allowed to use prescription medication without a doctor's note. 

Someone can be in favor of protecting bodily autonomy with respect to the invasiveness of abortion (saying the government cannot compel you to donate your body parts) while opposing bodily autonomy with respect to the invasiveness of euthanasia (saying the government can prevent you from harming yourself). In both of these cases, a person could be against self-harm.

And someone can be in favor of bodily autonomy with respect to euthanasia (the government cannot stop you from harming yourself) while being against bodily autonomy with respect to abortion (the government can force you to support another's life if you're the only one who can support them). In both of these cases, a person could be against harming others.

The reason for this goes back to the civil rights movement, where there were plenty of ""whites only"" establishments that refused to serve people of color.

It's certainly possible to have a democracy that's not incredibly 2-sided, and indeed most countries are like this, with the United States being an exception due to its electoral system entrenching a 2-party system and that system becoming a strong part of culture.

ieu3gqe,CorsairKing,"I think your argument misses the importance that pro-lifers place on individual responsibility. Many people believe that a pregnant mother who conceives a healthy, unborn child via consensual intercourse has implicitly accepted the responsibility to carry that child to term (barring any serious medical complications). It's not just about the value of the unborn life--it's about the mother's choice to deal with the natural consequences of sexual intercourse. A pro-lifer may believe that a child in utero has some entitlement to the support of a woman's body because the woman voluntarily partcipated in the child's conception. I believe this is the same ethical justification that the State uses to justify garnering an absentee father's wages for child support: the fact that he doesn't want to pay for the child's expenses is irrelevant in the face of his responsibility to it.

This same direct relationship of obligation does not exist between a potential organ donor and organ recipient. Especially when we're discussing the recently deceased, the relation between donor and recipient is purely incidental.",7/4/22 9:38,7/4/22 9:38

iex034d,distractonaut,"&gt;I think most people can get behind this but there is a small problem here. And that's the fact that a woman has the ability to not only control if she wants to keep the child or not but also using the government to compel the father to pay a large amount of money for years. Considering there's pretty much only one way to procreate both parties in that act have to realize that there is a possibility their actions could result in a pregnancy. You may not want the pregnancy to happen or to become a parent but recreational sex is still sex, which can result in a pregnancy, when you consent to an adult activity you need a certain level of awareness and responsibility.

First of all, being pro-choice doesn't mean also believing gathers should be forced to pay child support. Those are two separate issues. 

Secondly, having to pay child support isn't an infringement on bodily autonomy the way having to birth a child is - a more apt comparison would be if the father was legally compelled to give blood every two months in case the kid needs it, and also be forced to donate any organs the kid needs at any point in your lifetime. 

&gt;Calling pregnancy a punishment for simply having fun is a terrible way to put it and shows a very self-centered mentality

That's not what people mean at all. It's about challenging the idea that women deserve to be forced to give birth, and that by choosing to have sex they forfeit any right to bodily autonomy. Society in general shames women for having and enjoying sex a lot more than men, and I've definitely seen the mentality of 'why should she get a free pass for being a slut, she should have consequences'.

I work in municipal government in a rural area of the Midwest. In my experience, small towns often desperately want to attract factories, prisons, Amazon distribution centers, and other means of making the town grow. People who own farmland in small towns are the rich people for that town, and maybe they want to stay that way and oppose growth? But in my experience they will happily sell to a developer at the first possible opportunity, and clear cut all those trees if they think they can make a buck off them.. It's honestly kind of gross how slavish small towns can be when they think they might get some growth.

Likewise, if you had to shoot an intruder, and they have fallen down and ceased to respond, no further violence is justified(and you should call them an ambulance).

For example, they could trick someone to go onto their property, then kill or hurt the ""intruder"" and later claim that they were convinced that the other was there illegally.

ieztpeg,poprostumort,"Point number 1: Race and gender, while both being a social construct, are fundamentally different. Race is rooted only in an interpretation of appearance to fit a made-up category, while gender is based on interpretation of appearance to fit an a category based on biology. Which is exact reason why they are treated differently. Race is completely made up thing so your body will not have any problems with you being race X. But gender assumes sex which is based on biology (on several factors), so being labelled as one gender can create issues due to having a mismatch - firing up a gender dysphoria.  


Point number 2: They would be denied because there is no inherent biological factor that makes someone ""truly an amputee"". This means that we can safely assume it's just an issue with someone's psyche. There are however notions of inherent biological factors that make someone ""truly a different gender"" as f.ex. brain differences between cis and trans person. Which means that it is safer to assume that this is more that na issue with someone's psyche. 

Point number 3: Main difference is that in case of body dysmorphic disorder the issue is an obsessive idea about an aspect in one's body. There is no safe body modification that  will fulfill this disorder because the case is in one's mind.

So instead of only thinking about this situation from the point of view of a homeowner trying to protect their property, pretend you are a sociopath and are trying to get away with crime.

My first thought, is that I would *love* any laws that make murder clearly justified in certain contexts, because that means I can legally commit murder as long as I orchestrate those contexts.

Maybe I just invite a stranger who knocked on my door to talk about their religion or political beliefs in for a drink. I can easily murder them and just tell people that they were going to steal from me. No it wouldn't be easy, and I would need to plan things out much more than that, but it wouldn't be terribly difficult either. You know any reasonably clever person could get away with it.

Maybe I get into a fight with my girlfriend, and in a fit of rage I murder her. I'm not a sociopath, I'm not particularly good at crime, and I'm pretty panicked. I call my lawyer.

I lie, no one can confirm or deny my story, and eventually my charges are dropped.

You want laws that prevent crime, first and foremost. When crimes still occur, you want laws that enable the law enforcement system to address them fairly and effectively. A lot of keeping things fair and effective comes down to judging situations on a case-by-case basis, and laws that determine outcomes by saying ""this behavior is legal under these conditions"" only serve to take away the power to judge situations with added context.

For example, society needs coal, but extracting coal is super dangerous, very unpleasant, and causes long term health problems. If you treat all labor as equivalent and pay people all the same money, nobody would choose this job, but society requires it to be done. 

Some people think of communism as everybody just picks their job and does what they are passionate about, but under that system there isn't anything to draw people to horrible but necessary work. Communism's actual solution to this problem is to assign people to their work. You have no choice, because people don't sacrifice themselves for the good of society. That's not only true of bad jobs it ends up being true of every job. Normally economics dictates how labor is distributed, but stripping economics out doesn't strip out the needs that economics drive in a complex society.

If they can then you may end up with an essential job that doesn't get done.

Yes, capitalism is flawed, I very much believe that corporatism and communism are distant cousins, but the benefit of capitalism is that there can be several different systems of control in different stages, and people can go from system to system, taking power away from one system forcing them to change.

Communism has a completely different goal, and that is to have the collective have common ownership of the means of collection. It’s a nice idea in theory. Even if we remove the part about how such a large systems means we only need a few evil people to make it evil, it is still not sufficient. The reason has to do with the one thing capitalism is good at: growth.

By nature, communistic system grow more slowly. Think of any massive business or government, and how long it takes them to act on issues. This is similar to why it takes communism to grow slowly. Who decides what needs to be innovated on? Where the money goes? The people? How would that work? In the US we hold a presidential election every 4 years. It takes months to campaign, and days if not weeks to tally up all the votes. Would every issue about funding be like that? No, it’s not scalable. So, we would need to promote people to make the decisions. What if people don’t agree with the decisions? Can we vote them out? This is one of the major flaws of communistic arguments, they never explain how it could work with 330 million people in the system. Communism works well in very small communities, just like a small business is much more agile than a massive corporation, but as it scales, it slows down and becomes inefficient. Capitalism on the other hand has much more decentralized areas of control, so different sized systems (businesses) can do different things, and ultimately net a larger rate or growth.

The reason why growth matters is because of population growth. Let’s say you have a pizza and cut it into 4 slices for 4 people. Then a fifth person comes. How can you ensure each person gets the same amount of pizza as before when there was 4? You need a bigger pizza. Capitalism is by no means perfect, but it is better at growing the size of the pie so people are more equal as more people are born and needing to participate in the system. Communism can’t keep up. Over time the system deteriorates because it can’t handle the population.

So what ends up happening? They decide a split. Lower class people stay very lower class and poor, upper class people get to reap the benefits of the whole. This is how China, North Korea, Cuba (to an extent, not as successful) operate(s/d). It’s the exact opposite of what people want. Class mobility shoots through the floor, once you are poor you stay poor. It’s impossible to expect somebody to become a doctor without some added benefit of becoming one. It’s not scalable. It’s a system that is mathematically doomed to fail.",7/6/22 9:02,7/6/22 9:02

Take [This Stanford Study](https://news.stanford.edu/2017/06/21/violent-crime-increases-right-carry-states/) where the researcher did a meta-analysis of existing crime data and said, ""There is not even the slightest hint in the data that RTC laws reduce overall violent crime...”

What happens is the hard working get the same things and paid the same as the lazy. There is no incentive to go above and beyond. This leads to less productivity and with that you get more poverty.

If your going to pay a surgeon the same as a fast good worker why would a person sign up for the extra stress. If you force people into the roles you think fit them the best then you take away freedom.

if3idkw,AnonWinds,"Are humans inherently selfish, or is this perceived selfishness only a byproduct of living in a system that necessitates it?

It's true that all people have desires, but selfishness shouldn't be taken to be the same as self-interest. Every person is suggested to care for themselves because they're familiar with their own experiences; but, to care for others stems from the same reflections that is sufficient to say we should take care of ourselves. ""Sympathy,"" for Adam Smith, is reflective as is self interest. We feel self-interest for ourselves when we consider what is good for us, and we feel   ""other-interest,"" or sympathy, when we consider what is good for others. The reason why the self takes precedence isn't because the self is more valuable or important than others, but because we can only know what is good for others from *their* reaction. We're likely to know what is good with people we are familiar with, and so altruism in this case is elastic.

But, selfishness is condemned because it's more often than not illogical. If no one, either because we are too separated to understand each other, or because we're inherently selfish in this scenario, helped each other, then no one would be able to receive help when we need it. A society can exist in this scenario, but it's not a practical thing to will. Everyone needs help with something at some point in their life.

As for the rest of your post, did anyone tell you to sacrifice your years to become a doctor? Your concern seems to stem from envy. 
Ideally when we have a duty, we would do our actions to the best of our abilities without regard to the results. Meaning, if you become a doctor, and your duty is to promote health, you would do that duty to the best of your abilities without thinking about the money. Would you do a less *because* you get paid less? That's unethical even in today's standard. 
Also, are you assuming that if a job is difficult, you get paid more? Or only if a job is difficult you get paid more? The former is false when we account for jobs that are difficult and don't get paid well. And the latter is false when we account for jobs that aren't difficult and do get paid well. The difficulty of a job doesn't determine your wage as does your employer (assuming they're the ones making a profit), and your employer is incentivized to pay you as little as possible in order to make a profit.
Do people who do less difficult jobs *deserve* the same life? Unless the determination of a person's life is how much money they have—yes, they do.",7/6/22 10:10,7/6/22 10:10

He's definitely a populist, in that his strategy was one of a populist.  Definition:  ""a political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups.""  Pretty much sums up a huge amount of his campaign.

What is on top of all of this is the fact that he is a narcissist, and megalomaniac.  I agree that he may have initially gotten into being active as a way to essentially advertise his brand, but as he got more popular, and closer to possible victory, his goal became to actually win, because first and foremost he cannot stand to lose (or at least be perceived as losing).  So no, I don't think all the ""election was rigged"" stuff he had prepped for Hillary was all just part of some clever plan to get that far, and then bow out to save face having reaped all the benefits of being in the public eye.

if3u8t2,freshflowered,"I think instead of “responsibility” you mean “societal pressure to be good at sex”, which I would agree with. However, these scenarios you’re describing such as not lasting long usually come from women who aren’t having orgasms. How many men have an orgasm and then sex is just over. So while I don’t think unrealistic expectations of male sexuality are justified, how would you feel if whenever the girl had an orgasm that was it, sex is over and you’re not worth the time and effort it would take to get one back. Because for a lot of women THIS is the reality. Bear in mind the equivalent erogenous zone for women of the male penis is the clitoris, not the vagina, and most women cannot orgasm through penetration alone. Not excusing asshole women, because they are out there, but I know a lot of women don’t care about size or stamina if they are also getting an orgasm.

With regards to ACTUAL responsibility, men will never know the burden of being the one who can get pregnant. Men wear condoms sure, but they don’t have to take hormonal contraception that amongst many side effects include increased cancer and blood clot risk. Even the more minor side effects like acne and decreased sex drive can be difficult to deal with. You roll the dice on whether to take these pills or accidentally end up pregnant and either have an abortion (which is an exceptionally difficult thing to do emotionally and physically) or stay pregnant and surrender your very own body for nine months and risk numerous life-threatening complications only to have a child at the end that you may not ever have wanted. I know men are held more accountable now when it comes to paternity etc but honestly I think this is a good thing because to have sex means to have responsibility.

I think you'r confusing cool and romanticized for moral and righteous. The fact is a lot of the coolest and most romanticized people in history and fiction are not good people by any measure of that word. 

People like Cad Bane and Bobba Fett represent the same thing that their more heroic counterparts like James Bond do. Absolute freedom 

Cause the cold hard truth is when you're one of the most skilled hunters in the galaxy, people leave you be. Everyone from the criminals like Jabba, the Empire like Vader and the rebels either actively don't interfere with you or make it a policy to fill your pockets. Essentially the appeal of Fett and Bane is the idea of being someone powerful enough to inspire enough fear that most people know better than to pick the fight at all. 

This appeals because most people in their day to day lives have no power. One word from the government, their parents, their boss, the police. That's all it takes to bring their world crumbling around their ears. To some degree it'd be amazing to be a truly free individual. 

There's also the fact that most prominent bounty hunters are absolute monsters that honed their craft. Cad Bane and Boba Fett aren't blessed with Force sensitivity. Theirs is the skill that comes from a lifetime dedicated to training and honing their skills until they are, in a word, flawless.  

Also most bounty hunters aren't that bad. Compared to the Galactic Empire most are practically saints. Most have some code of honor and rules they won't cross. For instance Fett does the job no take backs. It doesn't matter if his target offers to pay him 10x more; deal is sealed. Some hunters reneg on any deal that the specifics weren't correct (Like in the Mandalorian he refused to kill a child regardless of whatever deal he had prior). Compared to Jabba the slave owner, Vader the team and child killer and Sidious the Emperor their sins are drops in the bucket. You wanna be mad blame the Empire who literally set the system up this way. 

So yeah most people recognize Cad Bane is evil but they also recognize the skill and training necessary to reach his level while also slightlu envying all that give him. A true freedom and the ability to determine their own fates in a galaxy where every clone and soldier and citizen is but a tool in the system.

Others have no intent requirement and are considered “strict liability.” For example, if you drive a car while you are drunk it doesn’t matter if you knew you were over the legal limit - DUI is a strict liability crime. If you hit someone in the face because you are mad, that’s assault. But if you hit them on accident, you don’t have the intent so it’s not a crime. And it doesn’t matter if they were drunk - it matters if you were.

The law typically requires intent for rape. It’s about the person accused of the crime, not the victim. Jane could be drunk, have sex at a party, and drive away. She may be charged with DUI for driving because DUI is a strict liability crime - she drove and she was drunk. At the same time, John can still be charged for having sex with her at the party. Sex requires consent from both parties, and if Jane can’t make decisions because of the alcohol then she can’t have sex.

It all comes down to public policy decisions. Do we want to say that if you drink, you deserve anything that happens to you? Of course not! No one should be taken advantage of. Drunk people should not be manipulated into sex, or into signing contracts, or into any decisions that require them to make good choices for themselves. The law is designed to protect them from themselves. On the other hand, just because you’re drunk, does that mean you escape all responsibilities? Also no!

if89psp,OldTiredGamer86,"I'm playing a bit of devils advocate here because I generally agree with you but here goes:

You have to consider that homophobia is different than heteronormative. 

Homophobia is fear/distain for people who are homosexual, a homophobic person could be expected to be mean to a gay man or a lesbian woman. 

Someone who supports heteronormativity is someone who thinks/promotes the idea that its ""normal"" to be strait, this is generally based off the notion that most people are strait, in the same way most people are not dwarfs. Someone who is heteronormative would probably be nice to someone who is gay (just like they would be nice to someone with dwarfism), but would believe that they/their lifestyle is atypical. Something like having the only kiss in a film being a homosexual one could (in a heteronormative persons eye) imply to children that most people (or a very larger percentage) are gay, but heteronormative people view homosexuality as more of an anomaly.

Lately there has been a significant increase in the amount of representation of LGBTQ+ people in film television and video games, this is good, but many people note that we're approaching a point of significant overrepresentation (more so with minorities than LGBTQ people)

While many people would argue heteronormativity is simply another form of homophobia, there are some key differences between the two. (though I would personally argue they're both bad, but one is ""more bad"" than the other)

The 'stupid' element though is a changeable view.

This is ignoring the cost of that security. It is like saying anyone who doesn't have insurance is stupid' when they might assess it as the cost of paying a monthly premium for a service they are unlikely to need is not worth the potential payout. That they would be better saving their money to cover an unexpected cost than paying for something that might not happen. I dont pay for phone insurance- I dont consider the cost/benefit worth it. Whether you agree or not that isn't an implicitly stupid stance to take. 

When viewing this issue purely selfishly' it is an issue of risk analysis and cost/benefit. Someone in a secure position may not consider protecting against a low risk worth the cost. Using your examples' in scenario B/D their assessment was correct and purely selfishly they were correct to not want to finance a welfare system they didn't use.

The idea behind Bumble is to provide a service that caters to women who would like to manage their dating app more easily. It allows them to control the flow of matches.

ifcmpt0,PlatosPotatos,"A few considerations:

**First, you've assumed a narrow utilitarian framework.** That is, all your reasons can be boiled down to, ""murder is wrong because it causes pain"" (or forms of pain, like fear or grief). There is no consideration of one's right to live, nor of moral principles that might exist regardless of whether a particular outcome is good or not. It's worth considering that there are other moral frameworks out there, and there are reasons to be skeptical of utilitarianism. But that's a whole can of worms, so I'll stick to a utilitarian analysis.

**Second, it assumes perfect knowledge**. Part of the reason that even many utilitarians would reject this sort of thinking is that it is impossible. You simply cannot know that a crime won't be discovered. You cannot know with 100% certainty that this hermit actually has no one who cares about him. You cannot even know that killing him will be painless. Are you so practiced and precise that you're certain beyond all doubt exactly how to kill him instantaneously, with no chance for error? Do you know what comes after death, so that you can say with certainty that he won't greatly suffer there?

Entertaining moral hypotheticals is fun, but we usually make them to draw real conclusions about how we should act. If we're to gain a lesson from your scenario, it might be that building uncertainty into your moral calculus is a good idea, precisely because these assumptions are impossible. And if we add in uncertainty, this scenario would always be immoral (unless you believed there were corresponding *good* outcomes from killing him that would outweigh the possible bad outcomes).

**Third, even restricted to your hypothetical, you do not consider the hermit's potential happiness.** Even if the hermit does not experience pain in the moment, you are snuffing out any future happiness he may encounter. Assuming that you believe that happiness is a desirable thing, removing its possibility would be bad. You could try to counter this by saying that it's more likely he'll live a painful, unhappy life than a happy one. But again, you're not a soothsayer. You simply do not know what his life will be like (indeed, we don't even know what his life is like *now*, except that he is a hermit).

**Fourth, you also don't consider how this would affect** ***the person who does the killing***. People who kill other people very often suffer significant negative psychological consequences, even when that killing was justified. Aversion to murdering other people is hardwired into our biology, not to mention how ingrained it becomes through cultural reinforcement. To kill someone in the absence of any reason at all would almost certainly be bad for the killer--and assuming this person returns to society, it would in turn be bad for society.",7/8/22 7:52,7/8/22 7:52

ifd2gbo,Gatoloko24,"To answer your first question about a fair standard for drawing a district: well there really isn’t one. *Essentially state legislatures and one political party control the redrawing process. So they get full control on how political races are carried out.* 

So the way gerrymandering is actually carried out is through 2 techniques, “cracking” and “packing”. 

Cracking is when people with the same characteristics, such as voting preferences into multiple districts. Their voting strength becomes diluted and so they end up struggling to elect their preferred candidate in any district. 

Packing is then the opposite, where voters with the same political beliefs are packed into a few areas, thus giving them mostly all the voting strength. What happens with the rest of the areas is that people in those areas do not have voting strength that those few areas do. 

**To answer your question about the “potential” to gerrymander.. well in 2010 republicans tried to gain as much control as state legislatures as possible.They ended up controlling 213 congressional districts and what followed was the redrawing of maps and some of the most extreme cases of gerrymandering in history. In battle ground Pennsylvania, republicans locked down on 13 of 18 of the states congressional districts even in elections where democrats won the majority of the statewide congressional vote.** 

As a matter of fact, your state of Michigan has been victim to some of the worst cases of gerrymandering, which gave republicans an extra 7 to 10 Republican seats in the House of Representatives. 

*To answer your last question, remember that packing and cracking can be done independently of one another or together. The ultimate goal of them is to give some districts more power than others even though it is not representational of the actual cities and towns in a state and how they vote.*

Remember that with more power in the HoR, that’s federal power, they control the direction of our country.

ifgd4tk,xylek64,"I agree with your sentiment. I am also very passionate about climate change.

However, it's not as simple as people often make it sound. Our society is, quite literally, built on unsustainable practices. Uprooting that is not something that is in the power of any one politician, so making it our #1 priority is both unrealistic and impossible to happen within 10-20 years. I'll use the example I'm currently seeing play out.

I work as an engineer at a natural gas combined cycle power plant. It's a smaller plant, with 3 units (3 gas turbines, 3 steam turbines) that produce around 250-300 MW each, for a combined base load of 900 MW. Some larger scale plants produce MW in the thousands.

Our company recently shut down a bunch of coal plants. We're now facing a summer of record-breaking heat waves without a whole fleet of power production. We have been purchasing up to 3000 MW of power to meet demand than we are making just to keep the lights on for people, and a lot of that power is being purchased from neighboring independent fossil power plants. Currently, the company is making plans to replace the power lost from the coal plants by building some clean energy plants. But there's a large debate on how that needs to be done.

Solar energy is one of the most inefficient methods of producing power. The panels require a lot of space. Even with solar cells being as advanced as they are, it takes around 3 acres to produce 1 MW of power. So, for a solar farm to match what we produce at my plant, they would have to clear cut around 5-6 square miles to install the panels. Additionally, we don't have a good way to store energy, so in the evening, during peak demand, the solar panels are producing nothing. Then any day you have rain or clouds, you're out of luck.

Wind farms have a similar issue with the space to power ratio. They just can't produce as much per land mass as coal or gas. Wind turbines obviously have to be in very windy places. You'll only see wind farms in any significance in the midwest, around flatlands in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. These are useless in most of the US where the wind is not blowing all the time, and of course, weather affects them too.

Hydro is actually quite efficient, but it's not possible to make them on a large enough scale to replace coal or gas. For example, one of our largest hydro plants produces about 80 MW. And we only have so many rivers we can dam up.

Nuclear is one of the best methods of producing power. It's totally clean, doesn't take up a lot of land mass, and it produces a lot of power. One unit can generate between 500-1000 MW, and some plants have 3-5 units. But the red tape regulations around designing nuclear plants makes it hard to build and keep them running. Many nuclear plants have been shut down because people complain to their politicians about the ""dangers"" of having local nuclear plants.

A big thing to keep in mind is when they decide where to put them and what plant to build, that doesn't happen overnight. For example, it can take years to get a nuclear plant approved because there's literally thousands of pages of documentation and regulations before they even start building. This will take billions of dollars just to build one plant. And they're complex, precise structures. Once they start building, it will take usually more than a decade to finish. You're looking at seeing that nuclear plant in operation a good 20 years from now.

And cars. Cars are moving to electric, which is great, sure. Although, electric cars are hard to maintain and fall short of gas. The range on an electric car usually isn't as much as a tank of gas will get you, and if you're on a long trip, ""refueling"" isn't as fast as just pumping gas in your tank. There's also the infrastructure problem, and I don't know where you live, but there's not a charging station at my apartment. The closest charging station is 80 miles away. Lastly, what do you think will happen when everyone switches to electric when the power company is already struggling to meet demand?

The best thing we can do right now is to focus on plastics, which would help with legislation, but there's a lot we can do as the people to pressure companies to reduce plastic production, or to pick up trash, or start recycling programs. Going green is important, but it just can't happen in the next 10-20 years. That's idealistic at best, and we need scientists and engineers at the front of that effort, not politicians. Politicians don't have a plan on HOW to fix the problem, they just make promises that they can't keep. In the meantime, I think it's more than okay to focus on social problems that if not addressed, would only serve to worsen the climate problem (war, for example, is very bad for the environment).",7/9/22 2:04,7/9/22 2:04

ifiwgxg,Genoscythe_,"&gt;There's this constant fear among both the right and the left in my opinion of cultures mixing and synthesizing.

I would comment on just that line.

I would say, that neither the left nor the right inherently cares about cultures mixing for it's on sake, their positions on it are both contextual.

The right primarily cares about preserving social hierarchies, (whether it is racial, wealth, or gendered hierarchies).

The left cares about challenging social hierarchies and installing more egalitarian structures.

The right will support cultural exchange *when it benefits maintaining a hierarchy*. US southern white supremacists loved borrowing black culture within minstrel shows, as long as they got to establish that they were on top of the pyramid and that they used the culture that they took, for mockery. Colonizers held world fairs where they showed off the exotic treasures of the colonies that they owned. Orientalist art was a huge fad in the ultra-conservative aristocratic courts of Europe.  Adolf Hitler was a big fan of Karl May's pulpy indian adventure stories, not at all worried about them being impure or not german enough. (He also ripped off the swastika from the *other* indians).

The right will only be concerned about cultural exchange when it threatens their supremacy, when it threatens their race, their religious authority, their family being automatically in charge of society by birthright, but they won't mind taking bits and pieces of culture from their subjuated victims or from exotic foreigners and using it for their own self-aggrandisation. 

So they will oppose immigrants becoming citizens, they will whine about minorities being respectfully represented as heroes in Hollywood movies, They will oppose anything that would direct wealth and prestige away from the current elites and towards the marginalized.

ifjd7ez,CrapulantDrunk,"I'm going to basically spend the whole time talking about your last point because I feel like the other points will be covered by others. The way you talk about martyrdom betrays the fact that you essentially have a utilitarian moral framework from which you are approaching the issue. This is largely at odds with the actual reasons for most of these kinds of suicides. They tend to come to it from a deontological position or one of virtue ethics. It just seems odd to say that martyrdom isn't a result of a sound mind because it might not lead to the right consequence when this line of thinking isn't the reason why most martyrs historically actually commit suicide. Socrates did commit suicide (and it was a suicide for the means to avoid his execution where readily available to him) because of a deontological commitment to the laws of the polis. It is not the product of some calculation. When Cato the younger killed himself it was because the republic that he venerated was being destroyed and his cause had failed. He didn't kill himself to cause some change in the world. You clearly are interested in what these people think because you spend a lot of time talking about it. You need to commit then to actually understanding what they think and not imposing your ideas onto them and saying they aren't rational because they aren't conforming to your world view when they never intended to.

I've noticed that this is true for all of your other points. You are clearly committed to consequentialism. Which I suppose is fine except you presume it to be true and by failing to even acknowledge any sort of other ethical systems you presume them to be false.

ifjlbif,Philiatrist,"This is a bit of a tired argument. The phrase as stated is intended as *hyperbole*. The sentiment is mostly that the US does poorly amongst first world nations, *given* that it’s the wealthiest amongst them.

But I’ll go through your points and address them and see if I can add some perspective.

Corruption, yes, not comparable. The United States has more of a corrupt bureaucracy, which is a different (and by some standards better) thing to suffer under. The struggle here is that a lot of the corruption is codified and legalized. Huge subsidies, bailouts, shadow political donations, laws written entirely by corporations and passed by politicians. A lot of our corruption is by and large, legal. It’s much better, but also frustrating and depressing. I can certainly understand why seeing outright illegal shit makes you feel this is nothing to complain about, but it is still very bleak when you think about just how difficult it is to change.

True, there is less poverty here, but you also can’t compare $300 in Bolivia to the US, the cost of living here is also significantly greater which means people need to make significantly more than $300 to not be homeless in the US. The conversion rate for minimum income is just not a good metric for poverty. Yeah, you can look at a fast food worker in the US making so much money and think you’d be so comfortable in Bolivia, but they also have to *pay the US price for everything*, so a huge portion of their paycheck goes towards the roof over their head.

Education is complicated, it depends, a lot of very powerful and damaging lies are more subtle than outright propaganda. We have a lot of textbooks with lies and a lot of people trying to actively rewrite history and minimize/remove Native American genocide and chattel slavery from our books. More recently, Texas teachers were advised they needed to present “both sides” of the Holocaust due to concerns that white children are being taught they are evil. You’re right though, it’s not so much one political party writing self-serving propaganda as it is white supremacy. Still a lot of shitty lies and omissions, it’s very tragic to see children being taught this way.

On paper, the murder rate in the US is about 3x that of Bolivia. I’m willing to believe those numbers are inaccurate, but major US cities are *much, much closer* to those of Latinamerica in terms of murder than they do any other first world nation.

The justice system here is still corrupt, but again, it’s more codified in large part than outright illegal activity under the table. Judges who own stakes in for-profit prisons have been caught sending all manner of vulnerable juvenile there on little to nothing. Because we live in a very free capitalist society, there’s nothing inherently illegal about being a judge who profits directly from a prison’s success and also being “tough on crime”. Of course, we have the highest incarceration rate and a fucking ton of it is minorities in prison for possession of marijuana.

Public services can’t be bought here in the bribery sense, but they still serve wealth before all else. It’s more like which neighborhood you live in depends on how you get service or not, there’s no option for bribery.",7/9/22 18:27,7/9/22 18:27
ifjnj9r,Sagasujin,"I'm a lesbian. Statistically most people are straight. Add in bi people, and the statistics for the number of women who are attracted to men are even worse. It's not unreasonable for people to assume that like most women, I'm straight or at least attracted to men. This is false. If I don't tell people that this is false, then my friends are going to try to set me up with a cute guy. Coming out let's people know to not do that. Conversely, because most people are straight, a cute girl stranger is probably going to assume that I'm straight and not try to flirt with me. Me being conspicuously out let's them know that they have a chance and ups the chances of the cute girl flirting with me.

Being out makes my life easier. It means that I get the awkward conversations out of the way ahead of time and that the assumptions people make about me are a lot more correct.

ifjww7d,koannn,"Ever hear the parable about the pencil? How nobody knows how to make a pencil?

It's an illustration of the wonder of markets and division of labor. There are thousands of people involved in the production of a pencil. There's the guy at the end of the last assembly line who puts the eraser on top, but he doesn't know how the eraser is made, or where the graphite comes from, or how the brass ferrule is stamped and rolled out, etc. And the guy harvesting latex from the rubber tree is thousands of miles away and he has no idea he's helping to make a pencil.

No one person knows how to make a pencil. And yet, pencils get made. Did thousands of people *conspire* to make it? Just the fact that a pencil is *desired* and someone is willing to pay for one sets this whole supply chain in motion to produce it.

Some things we interpret as ""conspiracies"" could be just like the pencil. Thousands of people are involved but most don't even know it. Some have only a vague understanding of a small part of the whole plot. Very few people need to know the critical details. This is the exact reason for the phrase ""Need to Know"".

ifkm2dg,spiral8888,"The problem with the charity in most cases is that for charities it's beauty contest. It doesn't matter how good you are relieving the world suffering as long as you're good at marketing that what you do is to fix the most important bad thing in the world. People generally don't have time to research what is the most efficient things to do, but just usually give to charities that make them feel good. That's why charities that help children cancer are flush with money and the ones helping less sexy targets but where the money could actually make more of a difference are poor. There are organizations like [GiveWell](https://givewell.org), who try to do this work for you, but I think a very small percentage of the total charity money goes through them. I'm sure ""well, I gave at the church"" is far more common. 

The point I'm making is that government can do three things here. 

One, it can spread the burden evenly. When the helping cost is done from the taxes it makes people less likely to freeride (since everyone else is giving to fix this problem, I don't need to). Basically it's the same function that the social pressure with the collection plate does. Social pressure doesn't work in modern society with millions of members as well as it did in tribal societies with 100 members. That's why you have to replace it with something else. 

Two, it can do things that are most efficient at helping people. It can test what programs work and what don't and then cancel those that work. The charities don't really have any accountability to their donors and can do whatever they want. 

Three, it can prioritize things that people democratically think are the most important ones. This can lead to the ""money to the children cancers"" to some extent, but it's less likely because of number 2.",7/10/22 0:46,7/10/22 0:46

It really is as simple as ""He resigned because too many ministers resigned, and the ministers resigned for the reasons they said they resigned"".

They resigned because the lockdown parties and because he gave a job to someone he knew was a sex pest, and his popularity with the public had collapsed because of that. They were trying to ditch him quickly because the constant scandals were bringing down the whole party (and looking at the polls, they probably ditched him too late, seems like they're basically fucked).

ifn5gfw,KallistiTMP,"Others have gone over all the reasons that we are almost entirely certain that EM sensitivity is not a real thing, and that all examined cases have been found to be a nocebo effect, but I wanted to add that another possibility for some people is simple misattribution of physical symptoms caused by something else.

As an example, say someone lives near an airport and starts getting headaches shortly after. They can see a large antenna array out their window, and come to the conclusion that the EM radiation from the antenna is the cause. A few months later they move out into a rural area and the symptoms stop.

The person might mistake this for confirmation of their suspected EM sensitivity. But in reality, they could have started getting headaches because of the poor air quality, or because of getting lower quality sleep at night due to the airport's noise level.

This is why these experimental tests that control for all outside factors are so crucial. There are many things that might *correlate* with perceived EM sources. The actions that people take to escape the perceived source of their symptoms might also happen to line up with something that resolves the actual source of the problem as well - especially since the things people do in response to a perceived EM sensitivity tend to be major sweeping lifestyle changes. 

The things that people do to avoid imagined EM effects also happen to line up pretty well with what your doctor is already telling you to do. Less screen time, more natural sunlight and fresh air, intentionally disconnecting from social media, taking more walks in nature to stay fit, cooking fresh healthy food instead of living off microwave dinners, etc.

So, while so far to date all studied cases of reported EM sensitivity have been debunked, it's not surprising that people might mistakenly come to that conclusion, and even end up resolving the actual underlying causes of their health issues in the process. It's incredibly likely that the majority of cases of reported EM sensitivity are in fact simple eyestrain, or insomnia aggrevated by electronic device usage or artificial lighting.",7/10/22 14:14,7/10/22 14:14
ifn7yz7,hungryCantelope,"your arriving at a poor conclusion because you started with a bad premise, I'll explain. Before deconstructing you position ill give the immediate answer to you question, ""why not?"" because their isn't demand for one.  Men don't want this, you offered a hypothetical reason for it, but having a space for men to support each other doesn't require women to be absent, you can have male comradery in regular gym space.  Your hypothetical makes no sense and it feels like the real reason your came to that conclusion was because you don't like being discriminated against so your looking for a solution is compatible with the fact that you realize the women receive unwanted interactions and that isn't sexist

To be clear, such a policy is sexist, the solution is actually pretty straight foreword.  If customers want to not interact with strangers the gym could offer an area with certain rules, basically a minimal interaction area, don't look at each other, don't talk to each other, any more than the minimum needed to navigate using a public gym. Anyone willing to follow those rules can be allowed in that area.  This would fix the problem without discriminating against men or reinforcing the sexist idea that a man looking at or speaking to a women is categorically harassment.(not saying women aren't allowed to consider this stuff annoying but the categorization of it has harassment is an absurd framing that if you sat down and really hashed it out with them they would realize they don't even agree with it)

Having a mens only section so they can bro out not only isn't desired by people but doesn't actually fix the underlying problem you have regarding sexism  As soon as you accept the premise that there should be a women's only section (implying that any interaction a man has with a women is sexual in nature), the you have accepted that treating people based on their demographic is okay.  It feels like you are trying to have your cake and eat it to regarding  egalitarianism.  Either you accept men and women are different and should be treated differently (in which case those difference would be individually addressed based on their merit, not in an attempt to even out some kind of theoretical scoreboard), or you you reject that idea and try and make everything match, but you don't try and fix a non-existent problem  in order to even things out just for the sake of a theoretical victory in order to bluster the illusion that you still subscribe to that theory. Because what you end up with isn't matching what you end up is just 2 different statements one for each group. If men interact with women it's harassments, if women interact with men it's disrupting bro time, see you haven't actually restored balance, you just even up a meaningless scoreboard of abstract points, one-to-one.

One last note, if there is an actual reason men want that, and we persrcibe to a less elgalitarain view, then we could provide that for them, but the reason wouldn't be *well we gave women something so we need to give men something* it would be becaue there was an actual need for it, the issue with you hypothetical is that you have no real reason to believe it's a need in the real world, you just used it as a prop  in your scorekeeping arugement, then said ""but why not"", why not isn't a reason,  and the obvious answer is it costs resource to have dedicated stuff for limited use.",7/10/22 14:32,7/10/22 14:32

ifq5ey5,hewasaraverboy,"Seeing a new trailer for the first time on the big screen is way cooler than watching it at home on YouTube

Like you said they are made to generate hype and that’s what they do

Sometimes when I see a movie that isn’t so great, the trailers are the best part of the movie going experience

Now I do think it can get old seeing the same trailer over and over again if you go to the movies a lot.

I think the perfect solution to your problem would be if the theaters posted like a trailer start time and an actual start time, but like other commenters have mentioned - then they wouldn’t get paid as much since less people would probably show up

A good rule of thumb I follow if I’m running late or something, is that 15 mins after the scheduled show time you still get you in in time to see the actual start of the movie 

But I’ve always stayed on the safe side and even prefer getting to the movie theater 20 mins before showtime bc the content they have like pre trailers is usually pretty entertaining as well.

ifqjnly,pfundie,"Two points:

First, in your system, children and people with disabilities just die through no fault of their own, as do people who are simply unlucky but would otherwise recover and contribute to society. Humans as a group will most likely never be willing to accept this.

Second, it's completely unworkable without irreparably damaging our freedom and privacy. What would happen to someone who can't be identified under your system, like someone who is mugged and left unconscious without any documents? Your options are either that they are left to die, or that they are required (under threat of literal death, given the stakes) to have some unremovable, government-provided form of identification literally attached to their person. Are you okay with the government chipping or tattooing a barcode on everyone? Even then, it could get damaged and the problem would remain. On top of all of that, there are times when literal seconds count and taking the time to check if they can pay before treating them would cause people, even those who can pay, to die.

As another example, if there is an accident and someone gets a life-threatening injury that they can't pay for, do they have to wait until fault is determined before they can get treated? 

Third, one of the major drivers of prices in the United States is a reluctance to pursue care until it is an emergency, as we refuse to cover anything that isn't. Routine care and preventative maintenance are vastly less expensive than emergent care. Your change would drive a greater number of people to only seek emergent care, as those without insurance (perhaps they can't afford it) would have to ration their costs. It would put an immense and unreasonable burden on people to predict the cost of their care, and I would argue that this task would be essentially impossible, especially for those who would be most likely to have to do it.

Finally, it's not like health insurance companies are actually good, at all. Their entire business model is to try to weasel out of every possible charge. What happens to people if their insurance won't cover a procedure that they actually need, at least not without a fight? They just die while waiting for the insurance to approve necessary care because some algorithm somewhere decided that the expected cost exceeded the expected income from that customer? You'd also be adding a massive incentive, by your own admission, in favor of health insurance companies, which would inherently drive up insurance prices, by an unknowable but presumably large amount, as they could literally threaten you with death or disability if you fail to purchase coverage. Do you really think that making them the only possible way to avoid random death or permanent injury for the majority of people would make them lower prices, or would they take advantage of this to massively inflate healthcare costs?

Look, at a certain point you have to accept that there are reasons that no developed country lets people die on the street anymore. You have to pay to dispose of the bodies, you have to pay for the resulting increase in disease from a combination of rotting corpses and carriers of contagious disease being out in public, and people really, really don't like watching small children die, so you would have to pay for the resulting riots and likely actual insurrections as well.

ifqqur5,pro-frog,"You say high status people like celebrities or the wealthy are the sort people instinctively want to love, but in your conversation with u/hashtagboosted you say it's not just because of their social status or success - it's the ""perception of someone's life competency and genetic quality."" So in order to disprove your statement we need to find examples of people who give compassion, care, and respect to people who are perceived by that individual to lack life competence or genetic quality.

But if people provide those examples, you suggest that they are not ""self-aware"" enough to know that they are not giving true compassion, care, and respect.

So I'll attempt to break down my own experience as a social worker to a more objective format. All of my clients are on a housing program - they are unable to make rent payments without government assistance. Most are not individuals I would go to for life advice, and many are fighting just to keep their lives together. They have competencies, but I would not consider many of them to have general life competence (though the reasons for that go far beyond the idea that they simply have genetic or personal failings).

-It is my job to give them respect. If they set a boundary, I respect it. Even if they don't want to pursue a resource I think would be wise for them to pursue, I don't push and I don't judge. There's always a reason someone doesn't want to try something that seems obvious, so it's clear that they know something I don't. I do my best to get the information I need from them about their progress without making them uncomfortable, and I seek to do the best work I can for them without crossing my own personal and professional boundaries. You could argue I do all that for the sake of not losing my job, but as you've said there are plenty of people in this field who are successful without showing respect. And frankly, if my workplace condoned disrespect to clients - lack of follow-through, disrespectful language, pushing solutions the client is disinterested in - I'd find a new workplace, because I know that approach is ineffective and cruel. I have zero people in my life who would know the difference between me working at an agency like that vs an agency like mine, so I don't do it for external validation.

-I show compassion. I'm not sure how to express this other than saying it outright. The people I speak to are dealing with challenges that are incredibly trying. I've cried with clients before about what they are struggling with. Acting neutrally and dispassionately in the face of that vulnerability would be cruel. And outside of the struggle, I'm interested in the other things they have going on in their life - their pets, their hobbies, their families, their likes and dislikes. They are real people who deserve compassion.

-I care. The first client I had who lost his housing kept me up at night for weeks thinking over anything I could've done differently, wondering where he was, how he was doing. I still do. And I do my best not to let it affect me, but I can't pretend it doesn't sting if a client I have rapport with loses their temper at me or says something insulting. It doesn't affect my work but it does mess with my head, because I care about what they think of me. Their thoughts and feelings matter, both independently of me and as they relate to me.

I think if we're staying ""in the same universe"" (as opposed to doing a reboot ground up with a new interpretation) it's probably best to keep race aligned with the characters we know - we are afterall very race aware.

Ditto for obvious family members and things like that.  Similarly, if we started with black frodo instead of white frodo i'd expect frodo to stay black across in-universe depictions.  

Is it important to the story? No . Will it serve to distract?  I think so because we're race sensitive audience members and have been anchored in the universe to a character.

There's no need to go back and retcon properties from the second half of the 20th century so that all the characters have more diverse backgrounds. We don't need Black Spider-Man or Trans Loki or Gay Ant-Man or Female Thor. Just *write new characters*.

Like, Kamala Khan does it right. They just added a superhero from a background we didn't see very much of last century. They didn't feel the need to take some pre-existing character and say ""Okay, forget everything you know about Magneto, now Magneto is a Muslim girl from New Jersey.""

There is a particular reason why some characters who are ""Race-changed"" are considered respected characters, like ""Black Spiderman"" and ""Female Thor"", and some are not like ""Black Frodo"".

It's to do with AUs (Alternate Universes) versus re-doing an established character. Miles Morales was enjoyed by the community not BECAUSE he's a ""Black Spiderman"" but because he was a new version of a character in a world that was made with different story elements in mind. Miles had a different upbringing than Peter, didnt have Peter's name, has different motivations, has different characters to deal with, etc. Same goes for Jane Foster and the concept of ""Female Thor"", she's a different character than Thor Odinson, different storywriting and characters relationships and motivations.

Making Frodo Black or of an Asian culture but doing nothing else with the character/world isn't what helps establish a welcomed diversity into an IP. How do you make an AU for an IP like LOTR?

ifswdn2,IAteTwoFullHams,"Where I disagree with your view is on the purpose of welfare.

Welfare isn't really for the protection of the poor. It's for protecting people *from* the poor.

Hypothetically, say there's a guy, and he's just a lazy piece of shit. He's got no identifiable mental illnesses or physical disabilities. No clear childhood trauma. He just sucks. He hates working, he's lazy, and he's a dick. He's had a few jobs, and he always ends up failing at them and getting fired or quitting within a week.

So he goes to the government and says ""My parents kicked me out, I'm homeless, I need help."" So we give him a little survival-level money.

iftgq7x,breckenridgeback,"'&gt; but the knowledge of evolution of English doesn't make me a better writer inherently

It absolutely does. Being able to invoke particular tones - whether modern or archaic - in your writing is a very useful rhetorical skill.

As an example, take the I Have A Dream speech, one of the most famous and impactful speeches in all of American history. You think MLK just shrugged and said whatever? No! He deliberately invokes the hell out of the exact archaic tone of the country's founding documents and of the Bible, in order to bring their gravitas into his cause. Look at this language:

&gt; Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation.

Why ""five score years"", and not ""a century""? Because he's invoking Lincoln, the guy whose statue he's standing in front of. (Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address begins with ""four score and seven years ago..."", which was archaic even in his time.)

Why not just say ""things will be nicer""? Because he's invoking [Isaiah 40:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040:4-5&amp;version=KJV) to a very Christian nation.

Patriotic songs. All archaic language, but archaic language that *means* something.

-------

Or, to draw on my own skill as a writer, let's compare a completely matter of fact snippet:

&gt; I think we should have more healthcare in America. It's bad that people can't afford it, because that makes them unhappy. In fact, I think our values as a country tell us that we have to help and support one another, and we especially have to do that for the most vulnerable.

Versus something like this, dipped into the fondue of American cultural symbols:

&gt; Thomas Jefferson once wrote of ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"". The order of those words is no accident. Life comes before anything else. It is the most fundamental freedom, the most inalienable right, of every American. The Constitution, too, does not forget its priorities. ""We, the people of the United States,"" it says, have a goal: ""to promote the general Welfare and secure the blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity.""

&gt; Without life, we cannot enjoy the blessings of Liberty. When Americans suffer and die, we have not promoted the general welfare. When we do not care for our own, we deprive them of the pursuit of happiness. Liberty cannot be only a theoretical thing, an abstract idea, it must be made as real and concrete as the Founders made it when they put pen to paper.

&gt; Our founding principle as a nation is to become a more perfect Union. We are one nation, under God, indivisible. And if we are indivisible, then we all must suffer as our most vulnerable suffer. ""Truly, I tell you,"" says Christ in Matthew 25, ""whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."" Would any of you today leave Peter to suffer from a preventable illness? Would you leave Paul without insulin? Would you have your savior walk on water with feet rotting from diabetes?

&gt; No, I say, you would not. No, I say, I would not. It is our right, and our duty, as Americans to rise to this national challenge. It is time to deliver our nation from the rider on a white horse, whose name is Pestilence, in the name of our Founders, and in the name of our God.

Someone in favor of good privacy might be in favor of strong end-to-end encryption for chat-programs, voice-calls and video-calls.

Without UBI the solution is clear - simply walking up to a vending machine and requesting what you want.  No need for some overly complex/bizarre ""pay it cash so that it's owner can be taxed so that you get the cash back to be able to pay it more cash"". 

But with UBI it means that Bezos owns and controls that machine.  The money aspect is zero-sum from his perspective, sure, but not the power aspect.  He has all of it.  He gets to decide who gets how much of what when.  Universally.  Such an entity should *never* exist.  And it is only possible with UBI...",7/12/22 7:45,7/12/22 7:45
ifvcix2,[deleted],"&gt;That's a pretty terrible hypothesis. I don't believe that having relatively easy lives will mean people just can't lead, and hardship doesn't guarantee amazing leadership either.

There is a saying among military personnel (and cops). That saying is ""Complacency Kills"" what does that mean exactly? Instead of explaining the exact meaning ill give you a great example. Former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe was assassinated due to complacency. There is no reason that dude was able to get that close to him with a home made shotgun in Japan. Security lacked because the Japanese where complacent with security. 

Having relatively easy lives leaves people complacent to the actual dangers in the world. You don't have to be a paranoid sociopath to stay alive but having experience with hardships keeps you aware of your surroundings.

ifvhemc,LucidLeviathan,"Studies have shown that achieving revenge brings, at best, fleeting relief to those who feel wronged. However, the act of *seeking* revenge keeps a wound open. Personally, I feel like prosecutors and the media wrongly glorify the notion of getting ""justice"" for somebody. It sets victims up to be emotionally attached to negative feelings for years. It also sets them up for disappointment if the punishment is not harsh enough for their liking. Their estimation of how the person that wronged them should be treated is also likely to spiral out of control.

Because revenge provides only fleeting relief to victims, judges should not consider it during the course of sentencing. Continuing to consider a victim's need for revenge (call it ""justice"", if you wish) propagates bad psychological outcomes for victims.",7/12/22 9:24,7/12/22 9:24
ifvnt8q,Doodle_Brush,"Damn, I'm working and had hoped to give every comment a reply before wrapping this up, but you had to go and CMV, didn't you?

I agree, the lack of benefit to society outweighs any perceived benefit to the victim.  The part about it only being ""fleeting relief"" is what sealed it for me.  The number of people who would truly be satisfied with any court-given revenge is likely low, and even then it might pass and leave them wanting more.  For others, not getting their desired revenge might be in some cases better for them than actually getting it, even if they don't see it at the time.

I still think victim's get the shaft when it comes to sentencing, and I still believe that campaigners for rehabilitative Justice are too focused on ""treating"" the criminals rather than seeing that the victim's get satisfactory justice, but in the case of court's factoring a victim's need for revenge in sentencing, I now agree it would be detrimental at best.

This diminished, rather than improved, the patient's chance of survival. You were opening a wound that could become infected; you were literally draining away a portion of the patient's immune system; you were forcing the body to regenerate blood when it was supposed to be fighting disease.

In fact, George Washington himself is thought to have potentially been killed before his time by bloodletting.

Your view is essentially ""The outcome of bloodletting proves that 18th century doctors did not care about the health of their patients.""

But that really isn't true. 18th century doctors very much cared about the health of their patients. They were just ignorant about what to do about it.

That is the situation that conservative politicians find themselves in. The problem isn't that they don't care.

ifzgtya,destro23,"&gt; Eating a mushroom pizza instead of a pepperoni pizza doesn't quite produce the same heat to forge that empathy.

But, produces more heat than eating the pepperoni without a second thought. And, that is pleasing to the gods. 

Take [this anecdote](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/5/4/985/htm) from Buddhism:

""On one occasion the Buddha gave a program for a king who had a tendency to overeating leading to slothfulness. The Buddha utilized the assistance of a family member. He instructed the king’s nephew at each meal to prevent the king from eating the last mouthful of food on his plate. The next meal consisted of just the amount that the king had eaten at the last meal, so that gradually the king had less and less to eat at each meal. The prince was given a verse by the Buddha to recite, if the king complained about being stopped from eating the whole plateful, reminding the king of the reasons for the program. In time the king was reported to have lost weight and re-gained his former vitality.""

In this case, the improvement in moral turpitude (decrease in slothfulness) was caused by the simple act of eating one less bite of food a day at first. And, it wasn't even a willing sacrifice; his nephew just manipulated him into being a better person. 

Empathy too can be cultivated by simple, easy daily acts of kindness. Even if they are only performative at first, and the person is not really enthusiastic about giving that extra 42 cents to the charity box, they still help to nurture a charitable mindset. And, from that chartable mindset, empathy can and will develop. ""“The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.” Great faith and charity can come from inauspicious beginnings. Jesus said it himself.

When you make it a rule that any sacrifice must be truly burdensome, then you are going to turn a lot of people off to the small sacrifices that people make every day to make the world a better place. If you tell people that god only wants grand gestures, then you are depriving god of the many small gestures that he has shown favor to for centuries, and you are depriving the world of countless acts of kindness that are done every day in the name of god.",7/13/22 5:46,7/13/22 5:46
ifzhd5g,VVillyD,"&gt; Back in ye olden times, the filibuster came with an extra ingredient: passion measuring. It was a stamina contest. To filibuster something required someone to actually stand up and discuss for hours until the other side got worn out.

But even this isn't true. On the rare occasions that just a single individual engaged in a filibuster it almost never actually blocked passage of legislation. When it DID work to block legislation it was always a coalition of Senators working together to trade off filibustering. There were always rules in place which allowed the filibustering Senator to hand off the floor to a like-minded compatriot to take over. They could temporarily yield for a question which ended up lasting 6 hours. Or they could defer to another Senator with more expertise, again, for an hours long continuation of the filibuster. Also, when these measures were used in a way which the rest of the Senate knew would allow the filibustering faction to delay endlessly they would still take regular recesses (allowing even more time for rest) at the end of the day/week.

The longest filibuster in US history lasted for 60 working days in 1964. During that time the entire Senate ground to a halt. Not a single bit of Senate business could be done for over 2 months. This is why the rules were created which led to the advent of the silent filibuster: to allow the Senate to continue on with other business until the filibuster was resolved. The silent filibuster was an unintended consequence of the Dual-Track Legislative Process. They should have just abolished it altogether at the time.",7/13/22 5:50,7/13/22 5:50

ig0tw07,McKoijion,"Remember when you were a kid in biology class and you learned about mitosis and meiosis? All living organisms originally started as unisex single celled organisms. They basically divided in half to create new organisms. Then they evolved to sexually reproduce. Instead of just dividing in half, so your offspring are basically clones of you, you partner up with another organism and give half your genes to them and they give the other half. That way you have more genetic diversity and your offspring are more likely to survive.

Humans are sexually reproducing multicellular organisms. We all start off looking the same, then we differentiate in the womb. That seam on the bottom of your balls? That's where what would have become your labia formed your scrotum. Your clitorus? That's what would have become the head of your penis. [Here's a diagram.](https://imgur.com/XL8l1ry) You can't see it, but similar stuff happens in your brain.

But say something goes wrong. You should have been a boy, but your cells aren't receptive to testosterone? You'll look like a girl. But then you hit puberty and you start cranking out dihydrotestosterone. Suddenly that little girl turns into a boy. They always were a male, but they didn't have the right signal to develop male genitals until they hit 12 or 13. This is just one example, but there are a bunch of other things like it.

Modern medicine has has advanced a ton, but society doesn't know how to deal with it. We're used to a world of boys, girls, and a bunch of inbetween people that end up being classified in one category or another. In the past, none of these people ever met each other because it applied to less than 1% of the population. But now they can go on the internet and find each other. Then they come up with a bunch of terms to describe themselves. There are a bunch of weird developmental issues that can make someone's phenotype (they way they look on the outside) not match their genotype (what their genes say they should look like). Hence people have come up with a bunch of nuanced terms to describe themselves.

Ultimately, no one is choosing to be straight, gay, trans, etc. Nature and a little nurture decide that stuff for you. You're just figuring out how to live with it. Ideally, you have an XY or XX genotype and a male or female phenotype and gender to match. That's the easiest thing to live with in society and it means you can have natural born children. If there's a mismatch, you just have to make do. On the children side, you can adopt kids and/or use various reproductive technologies to have children. On the societal side, you can just convince everyone to be more accepting of your medical condition.

As a last point, this is sort of a medical condition in that there's a clear biological cause. But being LGBTQ, having random genders, or whatever isn't really harmful to the person. If you have extremely white skin, it's a disease called albinism that makes your life difficult. But if you're just pale, it's no big deal. It's not a disease, just a variation from the norm. And as I mentioned before, the whole point of sexual reproduction is to increase the diversity of life. All these weird new genders aren't hurting anyone, including themselves. They're happy and people in society who have accepted them are also happy. Meanwhile, you're choosing to make yourself annoyed over something that isn't really a big deal. If you can get past all the straight person awkwardness, LGBTQ culture is actually pretty fun.

ig11h69,StickyBraces,"I am sort of piggybacking off of /u/akoba15's comment, but I'll argue my point slightly differently.

I agree that in an ideal world, ""minors should not be able to marry under circumstances""; however, reality often differs from fantasy.

I will argue against your point that ""Allowing 16/17-year-olds (sometimes younger) to marry is completely illogical to me."" In fact, I argue the very opposite: that it is quite logical and intentional for those involved.

There is certainly potential for exploitation in both ""developed"" and ""undeveloped"" countries; however, I would argue that early marriages in undeveloped countries are often a result of the socioeconomic/material conditions in those countries and may thus be a calculated move attempted to be made (and sometimes succeeding in being) in the best interest of those involved.

I'll be quoting extensively from ""Ethnographie Empathy and the Social Context of Rights: 'Rescuing' Maasai Girls from Early Marriage"" by Archambault. You should be able to read a PDF online here. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41407519#metadata\_info\_tab\_contents](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41407519#metadata_info_tab_contents)

Archambault is an anthropologist who studies the Massai in Kenya.

Archambault argues that a lot of early marriages come about not because of patriarchal values, but because of material conditions.

She gives the example of Esther, whose father is a herdsman in Kenya. The average age of marriage in the area has recently decreased substantially. Why?

Archambault gives two reasons. First, pastoralism has become almost impossible economically.

&gt;There is a pervasive sentiment throughout the region that pastoralism is becoming much more difficult because of the combined forces of land and resource fragmentation and dispossession, which have been accelerated by recent land-tenure reforms, increased climactic instability, continued state neglect, and increasing population pressure.

Marriage is an important part of building community among different tribes of the Massai. When economic hardship comes along, this means that it will be more heavily relied upon for the survival of the tribes.

&gt;Given these growing constraints on pastoralism, residents of Enkop must turn to their social networks for protection of and access to resources - arguably more than ever before. Maasai lineage, clanship, age-set, and marriage systems provide an institutional foundation for these networks. In this light, and at the risk of sounding reductionist, the continued (or even heightened) importance of ""customary"" marriage in connecting families to pastoral resources now under individual title and providing strong links of mutual support and reciprocity must be noted.

Second, education is not always reliable. This means that marrying off one's daughters may actually be more beneficial for their well-being than going to school.

&gt;So although sending girls to school is the path that most parents in Enkop are choosing to secure the future well-being of their daughters, the risks of dropping out and uncertainties related to whether or not formal education will lead to livelihood security make it less of an obvious choice than the human rights discourse suggests. In this light, choosing early marriage may be understood as a decision taken by parents who have lost confidence in the education system or in the economy or who do not trust their daughters' future to the hands of the state. So, contrary to popular belief, early marriage may be more effectively understood as a modern adaptation - a decision made not out of a ""deeply rootedcustom"" and ""patriarchy"" but, rather, out of love, concern,and insecurity.

Now clearly, I'm not arguing that this is an ideal situation. In fact, quite the opposite. Socioeconomic and educational opportunities need to improved in Kenya and hopefully we will get to a point where early marriages do not happen. That won't happen, however, without a nuanced understanding of the economic exploitation that leads to early marriages and attacking the core of the problem at its root.",7/13/22 12:06,7/13/22 12:06

ig2kg7j,neotericnewt,"What you're saying is that a fetus should have personhood. That seems completely absurd to me when, as you noted, a fetus (the vast majority of the time) is incapable of any thought, any emotion, feeling pain, pleasure, or anything else. It does not have the necessary hardware for these things to exist. 

The ""potential"" to someday become a thinking, feeling person doesn't seem very relevant to me. Sure, under specific conditions that's true. Under specific conditions a sperm cell will become a thinking feeling person, but it's not, and there's a very good chance that will never happen. 

Why would an unthinking, unfeeling clump of cells be viewed as equivalent to a person? 

I'm also curious how consistent you are in your beliefs. If you were in a burning building and could save a woman or a petri dish with a fertilized egg in it, which would you save? Would there even be a moment of hesitation? Is there any doubt that you should save the thinking, feeling person with loved ones and relationships and who will suffer immense pain if she's allowed to burn to death? 

What if it were ten fertilized eggs? What if if were a hundred? 

I'm guessing the vast majority of people would save the woman, because the fact is, a fertilized egg isn't a person. That it potentially could be a person someday doesn't make it equivalent to a person.

Edit: I also just wanted to add, your reasoning for why people get abortions was pretty gross. People don't get abortions because they're worried about getting food cravings.

ig2oeqi,breckenridgeback,"&gt; First of all I'd like to apologize, I am slightly neurodivergent so I do not see when I'm being offensive very easily 

Well, a good rule of thumb is to assume that people often have good reasons for making the decisions that they do, even if those reasons do not immediately occur to you. Dismissing someone's reasons for doing something as trivial, pointless, or too minor to justify their action is likely to offend. Doesn't mean it's *wrong*, necessarily, but it's likely to offend (and it *is* wrong here).

&gt; I'm just struggling to really grasp the whole picture, it still doesn't feel right to me to have to label when something is alive and when its just cells.

Embryos are *alive*, they just aren't humans on a moral level.

It's natural enough to want to put the world into neat boxes. But the fact is that the world just doesn't work that way. Fuzzy edge cases and lack-of-bright-line situations are very common in ethics. If they weren't, we wouldn't need to think much about it!

&gt; I'm still stuck on this mindset that all life is precious because we don't really fully understand life or death. 

Well, if it is, you've got some big changes to make to your life. It's a self-consistent enough moral philosophy, but it's certainly not an easy one. Almost everything about your life poses risk to some non-human creatures - even a vegetarian diet with modern farming kills large numbers of (say) rodents.

That doesn't make it wrong, by the way! It just means that if you find yourself applying a special standard in one area of your life that you don't in others, you should suspect there's some bias in your thinking.

2. It wouldn't be a good return on investment, because the government would spend two years training these people to be good at their positions; and right when they developed the requisite skills and knowledge, they'd leave and go to college.
3. Rebuilding houses and making community gardens is nice, but there's not really enough work for millions and millions of people to do that would justify the cost and resources of the program.

It might seem simple, but it allows for movements like The Arab Spring, Black Lives Matter, and Occupy Wall Street.

For example, it's quite easy for western trained musicians to look at or hear indian rāgas and think ""oh, these are just like scales, or modes"", then adopt this understanding and tell people they are using a ragas- which has often been done. The issue is that rāgas are a much broader concept than that, they aren't just scale information, they include a load of other form, style and time direction that western musicians simply don't package together in the same way. Equating the two is a massive oversimplification that erases a lot of the musical theory, culture and history of indian music 

The effect here is that you, just through (probably well intentioned) ignorance, end up stereotyping. 

It's therefore not enough to be merely good intentioned, you should also be aware to the fact you don't know the culture you are borrowing from that well and may make mistakes in your understanding of it.

The fact they are small enough to be easily stepped on without realising also makes cohabitation harder, and therefore makes them worse roommates.",7/15/22 7:18,7/15/22 7:18

igajhra,MostRecommendation84,"You've stumbled into a massive topic that there's a lot of papers already on, but the short of it is that a key component of culture you're missing is law/customs which are intertwined with social and political trust. Countries with high political and social trust tend to be more accommodating of immigrants, however it's also important to note there's a consistent negative correlation between social trust and diversity(hence Denmark/Germany having two of the most rapidly growing nationalist movements in Europe), or in other words, social trust is a finite resource that's depleted the more you take in immigrants, high political trust decreases the cost, but a cost remains. Countries with low political trust to begin with correlate with a negative perception of immigration and have a steeper cost in social trust when they take more immigrants on. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of real life-applications: social trust is linked to crime rates and corruption, political trust is linked to political stability. Political trust isn't directly correlated to social trust, however there's a lagging tendency for political trust to fall as social trust falls(likely due to the organization and growth of opposition parties like said above nationalists). 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR, you can't just stuff the ""nice"" countries with immigrants and expect it to work out because they'll eventually stop being nice places either due to political infighting, negative attitudes towards immigrants and/or the ruling party, or rising crime/corruption. This is a massive component of what reactionaries are trying to push back against in terms of ""culture"".

igaqpiu,poprostumort,"&gt;I personally know Syrian refugees who fled to Greece, what are you talking about? 120,00 refugees fled to Greece.

Those 120k weren't refugees fleeing war but people who were granted asylum in Greece due to international treaty with Turkey (as they were country that had to accept refugees in accordance with international law, which put quite a strain on them).

&gt;Sure there's a difference between method of transit, the people fleeing Syria did so because of the violence and war.

I know, but however cruel that will sound, that does not mean that they are entitled to use that as a free ticket to anywhere. This means that neighboring countries have to take them and prepare accommodations, and that those countries can ask other countries to help. This does not mean that they will get naturalized and accepted by a country that you need 4h of plane flight to reach.

Arguments you brought were never risen against helping refugees, but rather against granting asylum to large amounts of refugees who already fled the war - so against large immigration, not sheltering refugees.",7/15/22 11:48,7/15/22 11:48
igatd4k,poprostumort,"&gt;Your second to last paragraph does come across as cruel.

It's because reality is cruel and dismissing that will not change reality. Syria bordered Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey - countries that were accepting refugees already. After they were accepted, there could be further help, whether it would be financial (to supply refugee camps) or migrational (to grant asylum to refugees in other countries).

Simply accepting refugees in countries that don't share a border will mean that you are opening hunting season for assholes who prey on the same refugees you want to protect. Because some jackass will ara shitty boat, take a modest fee of ""everything you have"" to transport you in inhumane and unsafe conditions to a country that is ""so developed that they are literally giving money"".

If you accept those transports, then it's a viable business - meaning that they will ferry more, not caring if someone who already paid them for ""ticket"" will die during transport. All that indefinitely.

If you don't accept - then they may scam people in first weeks of war, but longer it would be there will be more stories of refugees who were sent back and share how they were preyed upon. Which meant less transports and less human suffering.

igbfi50,Interesting_Mood_124,"“Ah, I suppose a consequence would be that plants and bacteria have moral value. Though it is possible that they have moral value, I am willing to concede that this is a bit much. As a result, I will simply revise my position and argue that we cannot know what conditions need to be met in order for something to have moral value. “

I believe the sub rules mandate that I get a delta. If you could give one I would highly appreciate it.

“As a result, we should just aim to be as inclusive as possible with the kinds of organisms that we deem to have moral value to increase the chances of not accidentally disqualifying them from having a right to life. “

You should be inclusive up until the point inclusivity breaks down. If you’re too expansive and irrational with the right to life than it becomes arbitrary and any attempt at inclusivity would break down after that expansion.

“Bacteria and plants are radically different from human beings. In so far as we are more confidence that human beings have moral value than bacteria or plants, “ 

This is an appeal to human moral intuition which is what I’ve been doing this entire time.

“I have much more confidence that unborn humans have moral value as well. As such, there is larger risk of disqualifying the unborn from having moral value by using cognitive characteristics like sentience as the standard for moral value.”

But we know from human moral intuition that sentience is clearly important.

“You say the unborn have no ability to interact with pain or pleasure, but neither does a sleeping person despite having previously formulate desires. The fact that they previously formed desires is seemingly unrelated to the sentience requirement, and it is unclear how having formulated a desire should instill moral value. To avoid these problems, I would say that both a sleeping person and the unborn have moral value because they share the same potentialities inherent to their form to do so.”

I disagree, the utilitarian moral ethic, in particular the negative utilitarian moral ethic states is about reducing suffering for those with the capacity to suffer. Killing people in their sleep would only create chaos and create more suffering for those with the capacity to suffer as they can now not sleep to alleviate suffering. Therefore you’re increasing suffering.

“To use the Aristotelan concept of Form, each of us is a combination of matter and form. The matter in which we are composed explains what is particular about each human, while the form explains what is universal/what we have in common as humans (essence). The potentialities in the human form define and limit the ways we can develop and change (e.g. humans lack the potentiality to fly because we lack wings). As a result, one can be considered fully human by virtue of possessing those potentialities that make up the human form, regardless of the extent to which one exercise them. Feeling pain and suffering is a potentiality of embedded in the form of a human. As a result, even if the unborn cannot actualize a feeling of pain or suffering, they still possess the potentiality to do so. Similarly, a person who is sleeping may not be able feel pain or suffer, but they still possess the potential to do so by virtue of their form which possesses that potentiality. In so far as a sleeping person and the unborn are fully human because they share the same human form, they also share the same capacity/potentialities to feel pain and suffer, even if they cannot actualize those potentialities. And in so far as human have moral value, then by virtue of sharing the same form, then all humans are morally valuable, including the unborn.”

Potentiality arguments have never worked for me because sperm also the potential to suffer. It cannot be the potential to suffer that matters but rather whether or not it can currently suffer.",7/15/22 14:37,7/15/22 14:37
igbsvtt,elmonoenano,"I basically agree with you. But I think there's a couple of ways where it can be inappropriate. One is to do a very superficial version of the music in a way that reinforces stereotypes. Minstrel music is the obvious example that jumps to mind. People in black face doing exaggeratedly bad grammar or dialect, ""Massa Massa"" type stuff, that encourages and enforces racism. But I don't think that's the kind of stuff you're talking about.

The other one, and the one that's trickier, is the Elvis example people are citing. Elvis is a little more complicated so I'm not going to address him directly. But there's a spectrum of appropriation. There's lots of white artists that mimic African American music. And probably at the more clearly harmless end are bands like UB40 for the reasons you mentioned. They're clearly fans of reggae and are influenced by it, even though it's not very good. But the odds that someone is shut out from reggae music b/c of UB40 (Peter Tosh or Pere Ubu were probably never denied a show or a record contract b/c of UB40) is probably 0 or pretty close to that.

At the other end of the spectrum is the musician I love to hate, Pat Boone. Pat Boone used his whiteness to perform Black music (specifically profiting off of Little Richard) in venues that Black artists were shut out of and making more money off their music than they were able to. Little Richard couldn't play the venues Pat Boone could. He couldn't get on the radio stations Pat Boone could. He couldn't get on the TV shows or get the record deals, etc. And it was b/c of his race. So Pat Boone made an entire career out of Little Richards music and the fact that Little Richard was blocked by racism and segregation from most venues in society. I think pretty much everyone would agree that that was wrong.

Most musical appropriation isn't Pat Boone, especially now that most of that segregation is illegal. 

People argue where Elvis falls on that spectrum. I tend to think he falls closer to the Pat Boone side than the UB40 side, but he's not necessarily as exploitive. Elvis played what was considered ""race"" music back then. But he wasn't covering Black artists. Most of his songs were written by white label mates at Sun or by the song writing team of Lieber and Stoller. They were definitely appropriating Black style music, and there's questions about how much they borrowed or lifted and how much they wrote, but Elvis wasn't involved in that. He was just the performer. Elvis did play segregated venues, but he wasn't using his whiteness as directly as Boone was. So, I kind of put Elvis more in a category of a bridge that introduces an audience from one culture to the great art of another culture. I think the Beastie Boys did that for most Americans as far as hip hop went. Gershwin did it for a lot of Americans in terms of Jazz. And I think these people actually open some doors. You can contest how much and how fair that is, but I don't think it's evil like I think Pat Boone is evil.

So, I agree with you but I think it's worth thinking about these two areas where it does seem to be wrong. I also think that on the Elvis/Pat Boone side of the the spectrum it's not always clear where the lines are and what's exploitive versus what's a cultural bridge that generally improves things for everybody and that different people will come to different conclusions.",7/15/22 16:16,7/15/22 16:16

When I say things are more complicated and that people exist on a spectrum this is what I'm talking about. The biological factors that make up a person's sex as well as their ultimate gender identity are much more complicated than the other commenter was trying to make it seem. 

&gt; But you said gender isn't derived from biology or characteristics, and that you can be a man if you say you're one. So why isn't dragon a gender if gender has no definition or characteristics? If you say you're a dragon and are acknowledged as a dragon, then you're saying someone can be a dragon.

If someone says this to you, it's a bad faith argument. Consider what people who identify as nonbinary say, generally their sexual identification is about how they approach sexual identity and how they view themselves e.g. ""I am asexual, I am genderqueer, I am trans"" these all act to explain how they consider themselves. To consider the famous ""one joke"", how does an apache attack helicopter express sexuality? It clearly doesn't, it's a bad faith tactic to make fun of someone trying to define and represent how they view themselves. 

Beyond that, the current research as shown in the flow chart I linked lends itself to the fact that sex isn't binary.

That being said, this could be seen as something done outside work. A combination of recreation and utility. Fishing fits the same logic as well.

Now, lets also assume you are also not alone. Say two people hunting together. 

Daily bag limits in my neck of the woods are (5) per person of Rabbit and Squirrel. If you were to take 10 rabbit, that is actually a fair bit of meat. Rabbits weight dressed somewhere in the 2-4lb range so that is 20-40lbs or meat for around 1 a box of shells (25 count). Figure on $10/box - that is between $0.25 and $0.50 per pound. 

If you go multiple times, the license cost and equipment costs spread over more outings. 

Waterfowl has different limits - but some of the same economics. Ducks limit is 6 per day with a possession limit of 18. Geese is actually 5 per day with 18 possession limit. Coots are separate as are mergansers. Snow gees are limited at 20. 

Shells are more but that much more. Basic Steel can be had for about $15/box of 25. You could over several days take a lot of birds and a lot of meat. 

It is the same economics of small game. More people, more meat. 

It can be economical - but does not have to be nor is it always done to be economical. I do know people who do hunt for supplemental food for their families so it is actually done.",7/17/22 11:49,7/17/22 11:49

Even with the same species, the state variation can be significant. The average weight of a deer in Florida is only 115lbs compared to Wisconsin where the average is over 150lbs. 

The fact is, there are ways this can be considered economical and ways it surely is not.

Which man?

&gt; one ten-millionth the distance from the equator to the North Pole.

Earth-centric is better than Human-centric because as implied above, not all humans are the same, but we can all reference the one Earth.

&gt; 0 degrees Fahrenheit is around when people die, 100 degrees Fahrenheit is also around where people die.

Not an accurate measurement: I've survived working outside on days that were 100+ degrees as well as below-zero. By this measurement, I should be dead at least twice, and because I'm not, we can say, reasonably, that this is not a reliable measurement whereas water will always freeze at zero-C and boil at 100-C given normal-enough circumstances.

&gt; A Liter is a cubic decimeter of water... if that doesn't mean much to you, well remember a decimeter is just one-hundred-millionth the distance from equator to the North Pole, so a liter is a cube that measures one decimeter on a side.

One litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram. The cool thing about Metric is that the units are related, whereas in Imperial, you have to do more complex math to convert.

&gt; An Cup is a cup of coffee. A Pint is a glass of water. An Ounce is about one gulp. Table and Teaspoons are... 

This reminds me of that [anecdote about the first Polish dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowe_Ateny) that said under the entry for ""horse"" that ""everyone knows what a horse is."" It's not really a good definition or a reliably repeatable measurement. Who's glass? Who's gulp?

Even if you can't do all those things to re-determine what exactly a meter is in relation to the Earth or a kilogram / centimeter / etc, that just puts it on equal footing with the Imperial system, making Metric, at its *worst* equal to Imperial; and, at best, *better*",7/17/22 13:31,7/17/22 13:31
igkqowy,LetMeNotHear,"&gt;A foot is... about the length of a man's foot in a shoe.

Most people's feet are not a foot. There's enough human variance that to refer to something as 100 feet long could mean two *very* different measurements to two people with different feet. That's why people don't actually use their foot as a comparison, they just know how long the unit is. Like how people do with meters.

&gt;A meter is the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum in 3.33564095e-9 of a second, or if you have trouble wrapping your head around that, it's one ten-millionth the distance from the equator to the North Pole.

Yeah, but again, people don't actually use that. It's solid rationale for the basis of a unit, but people just remember the unit. Like they do with feet. I can say this with confidence, because I hail from England; the dreaded land where we use *both* systems.

&gt;0 degrees Celsius is when water freezes, 100 degrees Celsius is when water boils... cool.

This actually is a good system. You know that if it's below zero, there's probably going to be snow. And you generally know how cold snow is. And if something's over 100, you know it's as hot as boiling water. Again, a temperature most people are (unfortunately) familiar with.

&gt;0 degrees Fahrenheit is around when people die, 100 degrees Fahrenheit is also around where people die.

No. You don't get to do this. Your whole spiel is about the origins of the units, so lets bring up Fahrenheit's. The zero point for which is the freezing point of... brine. A solution of water, ice and ammonium chloride. That's not even the salt that makes most brines that people know about (that would be sodium chloride). That's completely fucking arbitrary and useless to most people. The upper limit is 90 (why not 100, Fahrenheit, you stupid fuck) and is based on an *incorrect* value of human body temperature. So you have the freezing and boiling points of one of the most common and important materials in existence vs the freezing point of an obscure solution and a mistake. Lol. Also, 100F is not when people die. Have you heard of the middle east? Arabia? India? Stays over 100F for weeks or months on end.

&gt;A Liter is a cubic decimeter of water... if that doesn't mean much to you, well remember a decimeter is just one-hundred-millionth the distance from equator to the North Pole, so a liter is a cube that measures one decimeter on a side.

This feature of metric is actually *insanely* useful. Makes it real easy to figure out how much fluid can fit in a container if you know its dimensions. Something's 1m by 1m by 1m? Ten litres of water, it can contain. How much is that fluid gonna weigh? 10 kilos. Easy peasy. What about imperial? Something's 1 cubic foot, it can contain 6.22884 fluid ounces... And it'll weigh 62.43 pounds. Christ. No way anyone who isn't a savant is doing *that* on the fly.

Metric is equally intuitive to those who live with it. Your mistaking *your own familiarity* with a system with its *innate intuitiveness.* I can say confidently that I can easily picture 300 ml, a litre or whatever else.

igm49e9,LosingPatients,"How would you handle interchanges? Lots of on-ramps and exits? You'd have to build infrastructure for bicyclists to both go past these unharmed as well as paths that accommodate them continuing on the freeway without crossing through traffic. That means every single exit and on-ramp would need both a path to continue along the freeway along with a path to follow the off-ramp. 

And then how do you handle exits and on-ramps in the left lane? That means you'd need a bicycle bridge for each of these that go the main path. And even then you'd have to consider the clearance required for vehicles passing under these.

And it's not just the cost of the initial building of these paths, there's also the continued maintenance, which depending on where you live and how your city/county/state handles maintenance, they might easily end up in a state of disrepair and become dangerous, to the point where bicyclists are at risk of falling into traffic.

I think your view is a noble one, but I just don't think it's feasible or beneficial. Highways are built to accommodate thousands of cars per day, and adding a path to accommodate maybe a couple hundred at most bicycles will just add an incredible cost without much added benefit.

Also, as someone who spend a lot of time getting around using a bicycle as a kid/teenager in a suburban/urban area, it was always faster to just go through city streets... highways/freeways are build to get vehicles from one point to another as quickly as possible without being burdened by traffic lights, stop-signs, speed-limits, etc. The main benefit is that I can drive 60+ miles an hour to get from one place to another at the cost of having to travel a couple extra miles.

The truth is, we know both are bad for you. We have 100+ years of research showing the effects of ciggarettes over massive populations. We have less than 20 years of wide-spread vape use, and manufacturing differs wildly based on flavour and design. There are class-action cases going through the courts as I type this. Would learning the Vape's are actually more harmful than ciggarettes or alcohol change your opinion?

The main reason we don't ban alcohol isn't because it's unsafe, but because so many people rely on it. Prohibition showed people are willing to fight, cheat, lie and steal for their fix of alcohol. We surmise that people will similarly do the same for niccotine, but at least we have ways of administering niccotine that are comparatively healthy. Whilst in your anecdotal experience you used vapes to wean yourself off ciggarettes - what if you had used niccotine patches instead? Would that have been better?

Looking at things objectively, e-ciggarettes may or may not provide a bigger over-all cost than ciggarettes. We know that they produce more waste, and we have good reason to think they are dangerous in similar ways. We allow people to do dangerous things for the sake of liberty.

An amount of hydrogen weighing the same amount has exactly one mole of atoms in it. Whereas in the American system, the answer to ‘How much energy does it take to boil a room-temperature gallon of water?’ is ‘Go fuck yourself,’ because you can’t directly relate any of those quantities.”

― Josh Bazell, Wild Thing

First off do you mean imperial units or US units... because the us and imperial measurements are different.. while metric is metric everywhere. 

""A foot is... about the length of a man's foot in a shoe.""

Almost no ones feet are this length. The percentage of people in the US with 304.8mm feet us less than a percent.

""The most frequently occurring length class for male customers was 270 mm for scans in North America and Europe, and 255 mm in Asia. For female customers, it was 245 mm for scans in North America and Europe, and 235 mm in Asia.""

With shoes? What shoes?  Boots? High Heels? Sneakers? Mexican Pointy Shoes.

Have you EVER confidently measured something accurately with a shoe? 

Cups... are you talking 1 US customary cup or 1 US ""legal"" cup?  Pint?  Are we talking Imperial pint or US pint or Dry Pint?

The imperial gallon, quart, pint, cup and gill are approximately 20% larger than their US counterparts, meaning these are not interchangeable, but the imperial fluid ounce is only approximately 4% smaller than the US fluid ounce, meaning these are often used interchangeably.

A US gallon is defined as 231 cubic inches.  If that doesnt mean much to you remember that 

The distance from the Equator to either the North Pole or the South Pole is approximately 49,720 furlongs. Multiply by 10 works out to 497,200 chains and then multiply by 4 to get rods which is 1988800, then simply multiply by 16.5 giving us 32815200 feet. All that is required is an easy division by 12 and then multiplication by 231

Another way one could visualise it is that 231 inches is 16632 points(the smallest unit of measure typography) or 1386 picas.",7/18/22 8:21,7/18/22 8:21

ignwgjf,fargmania,"It comes down to intent. The reasoning behind that intent isn't relevant to whether the offer was genuine, because even as a test the offer stands. What is a first date besides a series of tests anyways? It's often like a job interview - you are testing for compatibility. I myself have a bunch of tests in that scenario. Can I make her laugh, and can she make me laugh? Does she speak derisively or judgmentally about me or other people? Is she polite to the waiter, or rude to the waiter? Is there an awkwardness to physical touch, or are we feeling comfortable with casual contact? For me the right answers to these questions are signs of mutual compatibility, and yes they will affect my decision about a second date. So what you are describing is someone using money as a test. That's a turn off for me... but some guys probably don't mind being that ATM machine that some women look for. Also I am usually one to pay for dinner if I organize the dinner, but I'm a total skinflint in my day-to-day life... so it's probably not actually a great test lol. I personally wouldn't expect money issues to come up in the first date, but if a woman wants to put that priority front and center, then I'm happy to be done with her. Money is one of those things that no two people have a matching opinion on... and I've dealt with enough people in my life being weird about money that I don't need another one.

So to conclude... first dates are always about tests... and in my opinion being your genuine self is the best way to be in a first date... you aren't trying to win a prize (unless you are trying for a one night stand I guess). You are trying to establish compatibility. If she genuinely believes that a man taking up her offer to pay is grounds for immediate dismissal, be grateful that she was so honest with you, and that you didn't get mixed up in her off-putting brand of reality. But I'd say her offer is genuine - she sees it as one of the prices she is willing to pay to hone in on a single category of man to the exclusion of all others. I'd say the offer is very genuine.",7/18/22 10:00,7/18/22 10:00
igo0qjb,jackalnapesjudsey,"I don’t entirely disagree but I do think you’re perhaps attaching too much emotion to this act by calling it “completely fake”. 

Social etiquette is complex, and while your current romantic partner says that if you agreed to split the bill that would mean you’re cheap, that is unlikely to be the case for everyone.

For example, where I live (the UK), there’s kind of an unspoken social etiquette where If someone offers you a cup of tea/food etc in their home, you are supposed to initially politely refuse. The host then insists/encourages, and you finally accept. Works the same way when you have people working in your home, like labourers - it’s rude not to offer, but it’s rude for them to immediately accept. The whole “I said no to a cup of tea and they believed me and I didn’t get one” is kind of a meme here.

Is this a bit silly? Sure. Does it occasionally result in people not getting what they want? Sure. But are people being “completely fake” when they partake in this social etiquette rule? I would say no, they’re sincerely trying to be polite.

For hetero couples, the social etiquette here may still be in flux. Some people genuinely want to split the bill - I’m a lesbian so I’ve never found any rules surrounding this in my dating life. I’m sure many straight women are genuine about fairly splitting the bill but just don’t want another date regardless. Others might believe it falls on the initiator. And again, others might believe it’s socially expected to offer but that really the man doesn’t want them to split - its a dance to make everyone feel comfortable. They might expect you to refuse because they believe it’s the accepted social rule in their culture. And you can absolutely believe that it’s silly or unfair, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the other party is fake and rude. To them, you may have broken a social convention and that may give pause for thought.",7/18/22 10:28,7/18/22 10:28

The first thing to note is if this is for in audience of more than just the person you are disagreeing with, arguing against the person themselves is useless if that is the only person you are speaking to

So let's say you do have an audience of sorts, I can see two clear cases where I would find it acceptable to argue against the person themselves rather than just their ideas, the first being if the person in question is an actual political candidate who will hold office if they win, in which case the kind of person they are very much does matter not just the ideas they say

The second case is much harder to discern, since you never truly know what is in someone's head, but when you believe someone is not arguing in good faith, things like attacking Straw Men they know good and well is not your position, the classic gish gallop, the I'm just asking questions despite very obviously implying the answers, and many other such tactics turn any attempt at reasonable discussion of ideas into a farce and this needs to be pointed out because they are incredibly dishonest but effective tools of persuasion and you can't really point that out without stating or at the very least implying dishonesty on the person you are arguing with",7/18/22 10:46,7/18/22 10:46

If a group is beyond all logical thinking and is refusing to listen to reason or any other opinion, ostracizing isn't bad not are you cutting yourself off from an opposing viewpoint. Cults are a good example too.

Take for example that trend on tiktok where anti-vaxxers were sticking magnets to their arms to prove that there were chips in the vaccines, and some of which listened to pro-vaxxers explain the science, logic, and reasoning for the lack of sticking, or how one's sweat could briefly make it stick. 

There were two kinds of opposing opinions that happened here. One person listened, compared it to their own knowledge and opinion, and eventually confirmed that perhaps it was silly to think there were chips in the vaccines. Not impossible, obviously, but unlikely in the one they had received. That is the proper way to engage with differing opinions, their mindset didn't change 100% but they were able to draw a conclusion that meant they also did not 100% agree with their original opinion. These are the people everyone likes to talk to and have educated discussions with, i.e. basically this reddit.

Now on the flip side of that, there was a creator who would come up with every excuse under the sun to make their opinion 100% right everything, disregarding any arguments. Sweat is why it stuck a little? Nope, they supposedly barely sweat or swore they wiped their arm beforehand. Oh you don't believe that? Okay, they'll wipe their arm again and try the magnet one more time. Okay, now all of a sudden the magent doesn't stick? Obviously the chip is buried to far in the muscle now, that explains it. Everyone else is wrong no matter what.

These are people of whom no one should argue with because they are deadset on their opinion and opinion only despite being given logical reasons. The difference here is that they have NO intent to change their mind, even if they are wrong.

And this is why they get ostracized. Usually it's not purposeful but some times it is. Human beings can only argue so long until the other person has built themselves a personal echo chamber you can't break through. Then at that point it makes sense to not focus your attention on those people nor listen to them when you talk to someone wuth similar opinions who is open to actual discussion.

Name-calling is just what happens when people get frustrated, although sometimes some people have to just be called out for what they are, ""attack"" their person.

igpmjtn,LosingPatients,"Yea I wasn't sure how convincing the cost-effectiveness argument would be.

But I kind of glossed over the most effective point. The main benefit of the highway is high-speed travel with no stopping needed.

In order to utilize a freeway, I would most likely have to travel *away* from my destination to get to the on-ramp and then go along the route of the highway which is probably more miles than had I went straight there and end up a mile or several miles away from my destination at the exit, whereas if I drove there through city/town roads I would've driven a shorter distance, but would've had to deal with lower speed limits, traffic lights, and other things that come with it. 

So for a driver, using freeways is a trade-off of traveling a longer distance but at a higher speed(less time) vs a shorter distance at a lower speed(more time), even if that difference is just a matter of miles. A bicyclist doesn't really benefit from the higher speeds that a driver is able to utilize on a freeway and is just left with the drawback of more distance to their destination. 

Maybe it's different in your area, but as an example in my area we don't have heavy pedestrian traffic and generally cyclists are free to use the sidewalk as well as the road, and in order to access our main interstate you have to literally start climbing a mountain, as we live in a valley and our main highway is an interstate that goes along the length of the outskirts of the valley with a bunch of expressways as arteries feeding into it. In order to get from one area to another via highway, you'd have to ride several miles uphill, follow X amount of miles to your destinations exit, travel several more miles away from the exit to get to your destination, or you could just go from point A to point B and go a distance equal to X or less.",7/18/22 17:00,7/18/22 17:00
igpr8eq,Li-renn-pwel,"It seems you have been made aware that you are confusing cultural appropriation and culture appreciation at this point. I am going to answer your question “What is the harm?” for cultural appropriation instead of explaining the difference between the two. So there are three ‘types’ of CA (cultural appropriation) and they each harm a culture in different ways. 

1. Columbusing: This is when someone claims to have invented things that someone else has already invented. It is essentially violating a cultural copyright. There was one lady who posted a recipe of a noodle recipe that she claimed to have invented herself but was very obviously pho. This sort of thing is harmful because it removes the history of that item. It leads to cultures being perceived as having not contributing things. For example, a lot of Southern food is actually Indigenous food such as hushpuppies. Yet I have literally been told by people that there is not Indigenous cuisine because we were “killed off before they had a chance to create a cuisine”.

2. Mislabeling: This is more or less the opposite of the above. Someone takes an item, concept, practice from a culture that they think is cool or has a certain ‘vibe’ and puts it on a (sometimes) similar thing. One example is a WASP woman inviting her friends to a sauna where they drink wine and listen to relaxing music but calling it a sweatlodge. A sweatlodge is a very sacred ceremony among many Indigenous people of Turtle Island (North America). No one is saying that this lady can’t hang out with her friends in a sauna but why call it a sweatlodge when it has almost nothing in common with it? In this case it likely would have been done because attaching Indigenous imagery to something makes it seem spiritual and close to nature (due to stereotypes about Indigenous people). This is harmful because it actually makes it harder for people to connect with their own culture. I can’t simply google “sweatlodges near me” because so many of them are run by plastic shamans (people who appropriate Indigenous religions). It also makes it difficult for others to learn about it because they usually can’t tell when something is authentic and when it is a mislabeling.

3. Just the usual racist kind: this is when you reduce all of a culture into a trope or character. Did you know that there are over 300 different Indigenous nations in American and Canada? Because often in media if there is an indigenous character they are a mash up of whatever features non-indigenous people think are cool. You might get them having a Plain’s war bonnet, Mohawk hairstyles, Cree beadwork while speaking Cherokee words. This is obviously harmful in the same way any other kind of racism is.


ETA: okay, I guess the differences between appropriation and appreciation were not as well explained as I had thought… aside from columbusing, which is a purposeful theft, for something to be CA it must be something that is sacred, a closed practice, something earned, etc. Food is something a lot of SJW throw up as CA but I can’t think of any food I know personally that would count for that. When I have the example of hush puppies, I was not saying non-indigenous folks can’t eat hush puppies, I was pointing out that the miss-attribution of them have lead to their origin being erased and the Indigenous contribution  to American food culture being overlooked. There are plenty of parts of Indigenous culture that others can freely enjoy.

An example that more people might understand is Christian communion. There are lots of aspects of Christian religion and culture that others can freely enjoy and participate. Non Christian’s can listen to Christian music, eat food traditionally associated with Christian holidays and even attend church. However, with a few exceptions, the unbaptized cannot partake in communion. Some denominations, such as Catholics, require you to be part of their church to and/or in ‘full communion’ to partake. Communion is a very sacred part of the religion and for some, once blessed, is the literal blood and flesh of their god. It’s not that the entire religion/culture is closed for people but that there are a few that can only be done if you are part of the community or invited into it.",7/18/22 17:35,7/18/22 17:35
igprq3x,ItAintFamiliah,"Another word for the queer community is GRSM - gender/romantic/sexual minority. Asexual people are a sexual orientation minority.

&gt; Being asexual is more of a romantic preference.

Being asexual has nothing to do with romantic orientation or preference. Nor is it a preference in any regard. It quite simply means that someone does not experience sexual attraction to *anyone*. They may still be romantically attracted to people.

&gt; Sure, they may have been told they are weird and don't belong, but its definitely not the same struggles as homosexual and transgender people face.

I don't feel that an identity's validity for existing in a community should be determined by the average amount of pain and struggle they go through because of it. Besides, some trans person might grow up in a completely accepting and loving environment while an asexual somewhere else is being forced into an arranged marriage or heavily pressured into having sex while never knowing what's ""wrong"" with them. But again, in my view their struggle shouldn't mean anything in this argument anyways.

Also, if you consider the community's history to be important than here's worth considering: bisexuals historically welcomed asexuals into the community because they also were technically 'equally attracted to both/all genders'.

But anyways I believe that most anyone who's a gender, sexual, or romantic minority should be welcome in the queer community if they wish to identify as such.",7/18/22 17:38,7/18/22 17:38

igq2cv9,LetMeNotHear,"Very much so. I studied this stuff. It's a principle called anisogamy. That is the asymmetry in minimum parental investment, which emerged as a feature of the dimorphism in our gametes.

With most mammals, the minimum investment for the father to sire an heir is about 20 minutes of legwork. Easy peasy. Of course, this means that the optimum strategy for them to embark on is quantity. The more get you have, the more likely your genes will proliferate. Mothers on the other hand, are tied down for quite a while, sinking valuable time and resources on their get, of which they can have maybe a handful before a sabretooth eats them or they die from a splinter infection or something else prehistoric. So their optimum strategy is quality; pick the best potential father for your heirs as any time wasted on sub-par genetic material hurts your chances.

It's actually a really interesting topic, and one I can tell I've probably gone into too much detail on already. But regardless, the fact that the difference is natural and old does not mean it does not exist. These guys are wrong about the how but they're (somewhat) right about the what.

igqgg4q,Vameq,"Only to a point. It's important to note that engaging with a bad faith actor is only useful insofar as to show how they are acting in bad faith or to embarass them so that they can not move others to their positions with their disinformation and perceived superiority. What you're referring to about 'attacking identity' sounds like you're referring to an 'ad hominem' attack...basically saying that someone's argument is bad because THEY - for some reason - are bad. You're right...this is not effective and it's a bad faith move used to not engage with an argument...HOWEVER...if you've engaged with the arguments and you've pinpointed where a person is simply ignoring objective reality that's in front of their face...you MUST call out that this is a flaw of theirs and that they are not capable of moving the discussion forward in a productive good faith way. Otherwise you're being played.

It's good you want to engage and have productive conversations...but a lot of these people don't...they just don't care about finding the truth the way you do. Your insistence that we shouldn't stop engaging with these people is harmful if you take it too far.

It's useful to embarass a fascist and make him look weak. Fascism requires that you appear strong even though you really are not. Breaking down the ""strongman"" persona and exposing the weakness within is important to prevent the movement from growing, BUT in order to do this the person engaging has to know enough to actually do this and they have to know exactly when they need to move on and mock the fascist for their weakness and push them out of society. If you can not achieve that goal...do not engage publicly with a fascist...they will use you to make themselves look stronger.

Think of Richard Spencer. He went around putting up his strong intellectual white supremacist bravado and won over other weak white supremacists who wanted to feel strong like him. Once he was embarassed publicly and had his crybaby bitch boy fit he was pushed aside and no one wanted anything else to do with him. If you haven't heard that audio clip of him losing his shit after Charlottesville then you should go give it a listen. It shows exactly why believing in white supremacy makes you weak; The belief that white people are inherently better than others and that their rightful place is on top will ALWAYS be proven wrong because there are people outside the group who are better than them...always will be...and when they get bested...that recording of Spencer is what you get...an angry little child raging about how ""I am supposed to RULE them! They can't do THIS to ME!"" because all they have is a fantasy. This is why they resort to violence...when they aren't actually better than you they just have to get rid of you so they don't have to see you being human...being good...defying their fantasy.

Now to wrangle this back in...the same is also true of conspiracy theorists or other ""crazies"" for similar reasons. You can engage with them up to a point, but you're going to reach a point where logic, reason, and facts stop mattering. You have to drop it then because you're either wasting your time, harming your own mental health (because you may start to actually question yourself or doubt reality), or (if in a public setting) they continue using your words against you to win over others who can't tell the difference between your good faith arguments and their bad faith arguments. If a flat earther can gish gallup and rattle of more and more nonsense before you have time to combat it with facts that the audience can follow along with...they start to sound like they're the one with all the facts even when everything they've said is 100% bullshit they either made up or got from someone else who made it up.",7/18/22 20:49,7/18/22 20:49

In terms of cost of living this is a rough state to be a young person trying to make a start for yourself, average rent is 1600 a month before you factor in heating costs which run an average of 200 bucks. and you need to make an average of 50,000 a year to live independently. If you dont have a skillset where that is possible and you dont have a support network up here already this is a rough place to be someone just starting out due to cost of living. 

Our roads are in constant need of repair no matter where you are going there is likely to be extensive roadwork except in the winter which brings its own challenges.

You have to accept and plan for the reality that if your car breaks down in the middle of winter you aren't just temporarily inconvenienced you could be in an immediate survival situation. Some roads can be blocked entirely by avalanches in the winter. I used to split my time between Valdez and Anchorage the trip back and forth was 300ish miles each way. Every time before I left I would call and check with the weather station see if the passes were clear of avalanches. If they weren't I could be stuck in valdez several days long than I planned.

I can’t sleep, I feel like I can’t fully relax. My body and mind are afflicted by stress and anxiety which would be easy to manage were it not for the heat.

That sounds like it sucks.

&gt;This is the best season, is it? Give me your most frigid winter and I will thrive. A holiday home on an Icelandic glacier would be ideal.

You wouldn't if you didn't have the ability to warm up your living space... in fact, you'd freeze to death.

Your issue isn't with the season, it's with the fact that you have the ability to create a comfortable atmosphere in one season, but not in the other season -- so of course you prefer the season you're comfortable in.

I'm in a country (the US) where it's highly abnormal not to have efficient air conditioning in your home. In most of the US, it's also very cheap to own (or have access to) outdoor activities that help you cool down (like going to the beach, going to a pool, swimming in a lake or a river, etc). 

As a result, I love the summer! My house is comfortable in the summer and the winter, and I have sports I can enjoy in both seasons -- there's nothing unpleasant about it being hot outside (it is 35 degrees celsius today, where I am) because I only have to deal with it when I *want* to be hot.

If you remove the issue (not having AC) from the equation, I think summer is objectively better:

* More hours of sunlight means more time for any activity that requires it to be light outside.
* There's no snow to shovel or ice to chip off of my windows before I can drive. There's no black ice to cause car crashes or make me slip on my stairs.

I had a trans friend describe to me once why she was in a bad mood. It was a lot of little things-- all she had done that day was wake up, get dressed, grab a coffee, and walk to class. But she had already been misgendered four times. No single one of these instances were from someone who meant real harm-- they were innocent mistakes from flawed people who, when corrected, apologized. But by the fourth person my friend was frustrated, and tired of defining who she was all the time.

Its these sorts of little things that can really weigh on a person. Even if the person making the comment means well, and even if the comment is barely offensive, it gets tiring. From the perspective of the person committing the offense, its just a little thing which they can learn from. But for the person receiving the offense, that might be fifth little thing they've experienced in the last twenty minutes.

This is the much-maligned concept of ""microaggressions."" The narrative goes that people these days have to walk on eggshells because they're too afraid to make a microaggression. But, when microaggressions pile up in one person, they don't seem so micro anymore. They seem (and often actually are) indicative of a broader cultural attitude that does not care about that person's comfort or safety.

So, yes, its fine for people to make mistakes and learn from them. But if the person who is harmed-- even slightly-- by those mistakes has an apparent overreaction, or if it puts them in a sour mood, or if they just don't really want to interact with the person making the mistakes, please understand why. Their life experience is not limited to this one mistake, and it can be exceedingly frustrating to be everyone else's learning experience.

That does not excuse media-driven character assassinations-- though I would argue that most examples of ""cancel culture"" have had very little long term effects for the canceled person, that's a different post. But I hope it does help partly explain some of the very real and strong frustrations that marginalized folks often feel when confronted with a seemingly minor faux pas from a well-meaning person.

igtuhkn,LucidLeviathan,"1) It is a moral principle that the punishment should fit the crime. Fogle was convicted only of possessing child pornography, not of actually engaging in sexual activity with any children. That means that his crime was not violent. Therefore, even under your standards, he should not receive the death penalty.

2) There are three traditional moral justifications for punishing criminals. The first is that the punishment will somehow rehabilitate the criminal. Obviously, if put to death, the criminal is not rehabilitated. The second is the notion that harsh punishment will deter crime. This has generally proven ineffective, as states with the death penalty actually have higher murder rates than states which have abolished it. Finally, there is pure and simple revenge. Most people do not think that revenge is a good motive for the state to act upon. Revenge leads to an endless cycle of people feeling wronged and seeking retribution in return.

3) Imprisoning judges for presiding over cases where a person is wrongfully convicted is basically going to completely eliminate the chance that any of these people face any penalties whatsoever. Nobody in their right mind would preside over a conviction. The judge doesn't do the investigation or see the evidence that the prosecution isn't presenting.",7/19/22 13:50,7/19/22 13:50

Possession of child pornography may enrich someone who is engaged in the molestation of children, but it is not itself a violent crime. By your same logic, drug addicts should receive the death penalty because they enrich criminals who shoot people during bad drug deals.

2) Murder has one of the lowest recidivism rates of any crime. Most murders are committed in the heat of passion and are not premeditated. In fact, most people who commit violent crime will not reoffend with another violent crime by virtue of the fact that, as one gets older, their appetite for violence wanes.

3) I seem to have at least changed an aspect of your view. If that is the case, I would appreciate a delta. If there is a substantial penalty for a judge wrongfully imprisoning somebody, then nobody's going to jail. Also, there are lots of explanations for why false imprisonments happen. Victims can lie. DNA evidence can be falsified. Prosecutors can fabricate incriminating evidence or hide exculpatory evidence. Consider the case of Fred Zain, a forensic scientist for the state of West Virginia.

igypo8b,Full-Professional246,"&gt; correct, it is not ""establishing a religion"". but that's not what 1A says. It says establish religion i.e a religious belief into law

This is fundamentally wrong.

&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievance

There is nothing in this preventing laws based on beliefs - provided they have at least overlap in secular nature. 

This question is not inherently religious, it is secular. And there is a simple test you can use for this. If you ask the question, would a non-religious person have and hold a meaningful opinion/answer to it? If that answer is yes - then you most likely have a secular question being addressed.

https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause

&gt;The First Amendment's Establishment Clause prohibits the government from making any law “respecting an establishment of religion.” This clause not only forbids the government from establishing an official religion, but also prohibits government actions that unduly favor one religion over another. It also prohibits the government from unduly preferring religion over non-religion, or non-religion over religion.",7/20/22 13:39,7/20/22 13:39

ih0941t,EmpyreanMiquella,"Your statistics are skewed and not just because of what someone else mentioned earlier.

The 3.7% applies to worldwide, not per country. So no you wouldn't take the percentage, 3.7% and multiply it to get America's estimate of fraud per born children because that percentage is including all participating countries. 

And the discrepancy world wide ranges between 0.8% to as high as 30%.

2 out of 50 British men were raising children who weren't their own in 2021.

And the 30% range for paternity fraud came from a 1999 report from the AABB (American Association of Blood Banks). 

Lastly, it's important to note the discrepancy range of 0.8% to 30% because the paternity fraud issue isn't as big as you think, nor is it as easily recorded for statistical use. Not every child is DNA tested, a lot of the time there is no reason to question the identity of the child. Most women already do not put a name on the certificate if they do not know the father, and even if they put a name, the father has to actually SIGN in order to be liable for child support and have custodial, visitation rights when that happens. 

When fraud occurs, there are already laws in place to handle that issue if found out.

Secondly you can not put extreme punishments in place without being able to prove something was legitimate fraud. 

1.) If the woman knows this wasn't his kid, and leads him to believe it's his, this is fraud.

2.) If the man isn't sure it's his kid and signs before getting a test, this isn't fraud, this is on him. You don't sign first big decisions like purchasing homes, a car, or claiming parental rights over a child if your basis for that is that YOU ARE HAVING DOUBTS. 

3.) If the woman can not remember who the father is because the couple had dealt with a now resolved issue of cheating almost a year ago, it's not fraud to put her husband down, and once again if he agrees and it turns out the kid is not his, this wasn't fraud. He wasn't purposely misled and in this case, he was aware of a previous incident they worked through together.

For something to be fraud, you have to prove ill-intent. Setting up vague laws like this where putting a man's name down doesn't make him legally obligated until he signs, is wrong and also opens the doorway further for people to abuse it. A man could know the woman he slept with has multiple partners, agree to sign the sheet, and then claim he was misled into believe the kid was his when the DNA test comes back negative. Then boom, now the woman is a felon, going to get 10 years of jail time, according to the punishment you believe it should get. The child is going to have no mother or father. 

There's already punishments in place for fraud, including reimbursements for child support, emotional damage, etc. That is assuming, it can be proven too, and that's important. Punishments aren't for the vague, that sets the precedence for a system of abuse.",7/20/22 20:47,7/20/22 20:47

But the age rule should be treated as a necessary*but not sufficient condition* for a relationship to be acceptable. Just to go off your first two examples:

An 18yo high schooler and a 22yo college graduate is going to rightfully raise eyebrows. But would there be a similar problem with an 18yo high school dropout and a 22yo high school dropout?

ih2fn94,TuskaTheDaemonKilla,"When people argue that a pay gap exists, they are arguing that there are social and structural factors that cause women to be paid less in the long-term because they are less likely to get raises, more likely to have their career suffer from maternity leave, or they are being driven into lower paying careers. In simple terms, women's choices are largely responsible for the pay gap sure, but those choices are primarily influenced by sexist aspects of society.

One tangible example of this kind of phenomenon is the way teachers emphasize certain academics for boys and not for girls. In [this 2002 study](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20909/w20909.pdf), a group of Israeli researchers followed three classes of students from grade 3 to 6. They periodically had their math tests graded by either teachers who knew the kids or 3rd parties who did not know them. The teachers who knew the students gave the boys better grades. The 3rd parties gave the girls better grades. The tests were the same. The researchers concluded that the teachers who knew the kids had an unconscious bias in favor of the boys. They speculated that the same phenomenon happens in the children's homes too. The long-term effect is that boys are encouraged by their successes in STEM precursor classes such as math and sciences whereas girls are discouraged because they see themselves doing the same, if not better, work as the boys but getting worse results and less encouragement. Consequently, as they get older they become less interested in these subjects, and that's one of the major reasons why we have a lack of women in STEM. This is just one area where this occurs. The same phenomenon can be replicated in sports, toys, relationships, etc.

That being said, I'm going to go further and argue men and women are not even paid the same for the same work. [We have studies that show that when women enter a workforce the wages for everyone in that workforce decrease. By contrast, when men enter a workforce, the wages increase.](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/88/2/865/2235342) A simple example can be found in the field of recreation — working in parks or leading camps — which went from predominantly male to female from 1950 to 2000. Median hourly wages in this field declined 57 percentage points, after accounting for the change in the value of the dollar. Similarly, the job of ticket agent also went from mainly male to female during this period, and wages dropped 43 percentage points. The same thing happened when women in large numbers became designers (wages fell 34 percentage points), housekeepers (wages fell 21 percentage points) and biologists (wages fell 18 percentage points). The reverse was true when a job attracted more men. Computer programming, for instance, used to be a job done primarily by women. But when male programmers began to outnumber female ones, the job gained prestige and wages increased even before the complexity of the work increased.

We also have [Bureau of Labour Statistics data](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat39.htm) which shows that women working basically the same job as men get paid less than them. Notably, the median earnings of information technology managers (mostly men) are 27 percent higher than human resources managers (mostly women). At the other end of the wage spectrum, janitors (usually men) earn 22 percent more than maids and housecleaners (usually women). This is despite the fact that these jobs require essentially the same skills/education.

There have also been studies indicating that when you account for all the other factors that might influence the wage gap, primarily pregnancy, you still find that women are paid less (around 94%) than their male counterparts in the exact same job, at the same level, and with the same productivity.",7/21/22 9:14,7/21/22 9:14

ih2q7ju,zeratul98,"&gt;Well maternity leave is more of a norm because women have to have time off to have the child

Maternity leaves frequently last for months after giving birth, longer than is necessary to physically recover. The point of that extra time is to give mothers time with their new children.

&gt;Once again, the perception of negotiation is more of a difference between perceptions of men and woman and not of an actual discriminatory practice.

Perception of what? It seems like it's an expectation of how their employer will respond. Either that's a rational expectation, which would mean that yes, this is an example of systemic discrimination, or you think it's irrational and baseless, so then you'd have to explain why people hold this expectation.

ih4eu58,masterzora,"&gt; the MCU doesn’t seem to have that much character development for Tony Stark. We don’t see him suffer the consequences of his actions for the most part

Character development and consequences are two totally different things that are only sometimes related. Consequences *can* be the key impetus for a character growing or changing, but it's just as possible to have other (or, in rare cases, *no*) reasons. Moreover, even when consequences are involved in character development, it doesn't mean every sin and vice needs an individual consequence.

For all the problems MCU has, Tony still develops quite a lot from Iron Man to Endgame. Some characters develop to the point where it would be hard to see how their first appearance and last appearance are even the same person if you missed all the bits in between. That's definitely not the case with Tony. He very much comes across as someone who has grown up and put in the work and was still continuing to do so daily rather than somebody who fixed all of his faults or completely changed who they were.

In the Trump, post-Trump era in particular there's been a clear move to support ""outsider"" candidates opposed to the wealthy, educated elite. 8 of the incoming 2020 congress members didn't have a 4-year degrees, reflecting an appetite for a different type of representative \[perceived to be \]more in line with the constituents of some states.

Gender is not a social construct, it is a complex biochemical phenomena. You could have an individual with [GD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria) with no attachment to society or norms, and perhaps not even language—and they would still benefit from gender affirming hormone replacement. Gender is exceedingly messy and is determined by a number of neurochemical phenomena, with [structural differences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8604863/) being evident in the brain before any kind of treatment. These differences do not depend on any culture or societal customs. GD just hurts, in the same way that depression just hurts. These are real issues with real solutions, with massive bodies of evidence supported by the entirety of the medical community. It as close as objective as you can get for the purposes of human health.

*Gender roles* are a social construct, and do depend on the society in question. An important clarification that needs to be understood.

Lobbying is often *necessary* for any interested group. If a Congressperson is about to do something dumb, say he wants to give public funding for a Bigfoot Museum or build a 1:1 scale copy of the pyramids of Giza, and you schedule a meeting to explain what a *bad idea* that is then you have lobbied them. Very often, a congressperson who *does not understand technology* can propose something that would destroy how the internet works. If you outlaw a corporation from telling them that is stupid and would destroy the internet then no one will them and bad things would happen.

Ban corporate donations? Sure, whatever. Prevent corporations from writing ""sample bills"" that amount to them writing the laws that regulate them? Seems like a very good idea. But to completely gag them wouldn't work.

Corporate personhood exists to allow people to sue the company. Before corporate personhood the company was immune. You had to sue an individual in the company, who would inevitably argue that you sued the wrong person. Meaning, you'd have to sue *literally every employee and shareholder of the company* in order to hold **ANYONE** accountable, and the people who paid were not the people at the top. This isn't a hypothetical; this is the court case that led to corporate personhood. Shortly after the Revolution a man had a pay dispute with Princeton University, and had to sue *literally everyone* associated with the university.

ih68smv,Slinkusmalinkus,"Firstly, the US Federal Government has a legislative body called Congress, which is bicameral, meaning it has two parts: the House and the Senate.

The House members are intended to be representatives of the enfranchised population (whoever is allowed to vote).

The Senate members are intended to be representatives of their states (and, historically, representatives of their state governments).

The President is the head of the executive branch and seems now to be supposed to represent the will of the people as a whole, based on how elections are conducted nationally.

That aside, all those checks and balances that America loves are actually systematized ways through which the will of the people is stymied: the electoral college, the Senate, the Supreme Court.

To your point, it is less a matter of spending and more a matter of the socioeconomic status of members of Congress (House and Senate). This more applies to the Senate, but is also true for leadership in the House: members of Congress are kinda rich. Pelosi (House - D - Party Leadership) and McConnel (Senate - R - Party Leadership) are fabulously wealthy.

Also, you seem to be overlooking that so much of what you mentioned requires oversight or it won’t get done, and when people are guaranteed a job, they aren’t going to do things they don’t want to.

Let’s say painting a wall that was graffitied comes up on the list.  Is there some government worker who provides all the tools and paint for this person to pickup?  Is anyone supervising this guy painting?  How long does it take to paint a 20x40 foot wall?  What if he slacks off and takes a month to finish it when a painter who knew what he was doing would have done it in 2 hours?  Or does the guy get fined because he is slow at painting when he has never painted before?  

You mention spending time with people in care homes.  If my mother is in a home can I spend the day with her and get paid for it?  What if I go to a care home and find an elderly person who doesn’t want to talk and just wants to watch tv all day, so I choose to be with them.

You might be asked for the last 4 of your social and an ID at the bank (something you know and something you have). At the very least, a notarized copy is going to require that you have ID and provide a signature. They are verifying your identity. The Xerox machine doesn't do that.",7/22/22 8:56,7/22/22 8:56
ih7h9ja,Full-Professional246,"I think you need to separate out this view a bit.

There are originals and there are copies. These can be digital or real world or some combination.

In the 'paper' category, having an original vs a xerox copy. Generally speaking, originals allow for a much greater examination of the signature and the ability to have seals/stamps or other physical security devices not appearing in a copy. If you want evidence, the original is the version you want as it provides more opportunities to validate it is authenticity.

Moving to digital. There are mechanisms of digital signing to explicitly protect against changes. If you utilize this technology, you are creating numerous 'originals' to distribute. They aren't really 'copies'. A copy is a version of the document/file without said protections against change. Again, just like the paper side, if you want or need to verify authenticity, the 'original' is what you want. 

When you mix the formats, its gets more complicated. A scan of a wet signed form doesn't include all of the authentication capabilities of the original. It can though, include signatures and records of reception of this original document in its file and through those change protections. It can be almost as good because you have the file, as the authority holding the original claims it appears - with protections against changes. 

If your standard is merely a signature, then you likely are right. In this day an age, that is not much protection. (I kinda want to make an automatic signing machine now). But, when you include signatures with other tools such as a notary and registration of the document, you get more security. 

And to the point of your CMV, there is actually more to this than simple Original vs Copy. Sometimes a 'Copy' has more authenticity protections than an 'Original'. We should strive to use means and methods appropriately for documents and move beyond the simplistic copy vs original.",7/22/22 9:28,7/22/22 9:28
ih7n666,Tullyswimmer,"Hi, your friendly digital forensics guy here:

There is a very important reason to worry about ""originals"" and ""copies"" in the digital world, because *when* and *who* created those things can be extremely important for civil, and especially criminal, cases.

Let's say that someone has their computer seized and a digital forensic search completed because of a suspicion of money laundering or some other financial crime, embezzlement, or something. If the documents and files on their computer weren't created by ""them"" (being, the person who had access to the account that created or modified the file) then the level to which they can be prosecuted is drastically less than if they're the originator of the documents. 

Another example is cases that I've read about where someone was accused of possessing CSAM, or other types of illegal digital content. If the person being accused can prove that they don't have access to the account that created the file, then they didn't break any laws, and the investigation will be about the person or people who have access to the accounts that created the file. 

Moving to a civil case, if there's an accusation of IP theft, the companies involved must be able to prove the origin of the file, including who may have modified it and when the first revision was created, things like that. 

So, while in a legal sense, the ""wet signature"" thing is probably no longer particularly useful in the era of docusign or other things, there's absolutely good reason to keep track of ""original"" and ""copy"" versions of digital documents.",7/22/22 10:05,7/22/22 10:05
ih7o28u,AITAthrowaway1mil,"In the spirit of good faith argument, I’ll engage now that you’ve clarified what you meant by social security. (I’m sure you’ve figured this out by now, but social security in America is specifically for people who have retired after paying into it their whole lives or people who are disabled). 

What you’re saying sounds great on paper, but in practice you’d run into some nasty problems. I can’t speak to Germany, but in America, it’s notoriously difficult to prove you’re too disabled to work. I have a friend whose a lawyer that specializes in these cases, and she had to go through three appeals to get the government to acknowledge that her triple amputee client was too disabled to work. And even then, that client has to go back to the government every few years to apply for disability again, just in case he grows back those three limbs. 

So effectively what you’d end up with is a lot of people who shouldn’t be working forced to work with vulnerable populations or understaffed organizations. Imagine someone who lost their job due to a violently explosive temper caused by multiple concussions spending their time hauling groceries for the elderly. Imagine someone without the money to cover their psychiatric medication behaving erratically at a charity they’re working for, and diverting resources from that charity because now the workers need to focus on calming them down or going through the process of telling the government that this person isn’t suited for the position. Or think of the sort of jackass who would have free access to the elderly and steal their money while spending time with them. 

There would still have to be some kind of qualifiers and a vetting process to allow you to work in these different places, and what happens if a person doesn’t meet those standards but a tight fisted government doesn’t want to admit that they’re too disabled to work? The government, at least in America, would foist the responsibility for the disabled and mentally ill on the sorts of organizations and populations that already in vulnerable and precarious positions.",7/22/22 10:11,7/22/22 10:11

Like you, I sought out resources that challenged my thinking and eventually came to realize that I no longer actually believed in religion. Instead, I came to realize that I only believed I believed in religion. ""Belief in belief"".

Most religious people choose not to address the cognitive dissonance of that belief in belief. Instead, most religious people decide they prefer a world with an afterlife, where a guiding deity exists, where there are clear answers and where suffering is remedied through eternal reward.

It's a choice many religious people make--not usually a conscious choice, but yet a choice--to choose to live consistently with the belief that god exists because it's a worldview that brings comfort, while challenging that worldview brings both social discomfort and cognitive dissonance.

It's hard for people to break away from childhood indoctrination. Being willing to break away requires choosing the pain of dissonance rather than choosing to belief in god due to preferring a world in which god exists.

When you broke away from religion, did it hurt? Can you imagine people choosing to hide from that pain?

ihctb7m,Crazed_waffle_party,"There is growing support for ""Ranked Choice Voting"", which is an alternative to the ""winner take all"" election format in the U.S. 

RCV requires each voter to rank the candidates by most desirable to least. First, vote counters will see who received the most highest ranked votes. Let's say it was Donald Trump, receiving 30% of all high ranking votes. However, in a RCV system, the winner must receive 50% of the votes. 

Because no one received a majority, they then factor in the 2nd tier votes. Now Donald Trump has 30% of the first tier votes, but only 10% of the second tier votes. His current tally is now 20%. That's the beauty of RCV, it discourages politicians from alienating voters that do not prioritize them as first tier. Donald Trump in this scenario may have had 30% of first tier voters on his side, but he scorched the earth against everyone else. 

Let's also say Biden got only 20% of the first tier voters; however, 70% of voters choose him as their second choice. Suddenly, he went from being in Nth place to having 45% of the total vote. That's still not a clear majority, so we now add in people's third choice.

Although Biden was a lot of people's second choice, it appears that Elizabeth Warren, who had only 16% of the vote at this point, attracted a whopping 99% of third tier votes. That leaves Trump with 17% of the counted votes, Biden with 30%, and Warren with 44% of the vote.

The procedure will continue until all tiers are exhausted or until one politician gets a majority of counted votes. The benefit of this system is that no politician can confidently alienate one side to win over another. This system is used in many parliamentary Democracies and in the state of Maine.

ihcvbri,Castriff,"&gt;What will change my view is someone either pointing out a flaw in my logic and proving my statement is wrong, or proving that using our free will to choose to believe in God is not a requirement for a majority of Christian denominations.

I think the primary issue with your argument is a misconception about the definitions of ""faith"" and ""free will"" (or, perhaps more accurately, incomplete definitions of those things). I am not blaming you for this, though, because I think a *lot* of Christian denominations have lost track of these. This is what I believe: choosing to believe in God is a requirement for Christian denominations, but *not* a requirement for being right with God Himself.

You say that it was taught to you that ""Our faith in God is our free will."" I disagree. ""Free will"" and ""faith"" are not synonymous. Faith in God is an expression of free will. Our ability to make choices does indicate free will, but in that sense believing in God is just as much an expression of free will as not believing in Him. 

Faith, though, is not *only* belief in God, but also commitment to Him. It's a choice to follow what He tells us, and most importantly, to have a relationship with Him. When the Bible says ""we are saved by faith, not works,"" that means salvation is a result of striving to be righteous rather than only doing good actions. It is entirely possible to believe in God and then reject Him after the fact by intentionally choosing to ignore His influence through the Holy Spirit. Satan is the primary example, as someone else already mentioned, as when he was an angel he had the opportunity to talk to God on a daily basis. (Incidentally, this is also evidence that angels *do* have free will, not just humans.) It's also possible for a person to have a positive relationship with God without believing in God, simply by following one's conscience and trying to be a good person. All these things are also expressions of free will. So in that sense, certainty of God's existence doesn't negate the existence of faith. There's more that comes after that isn't necessarily implied by or connected to the former. 

I also think that it's flat-out wrong to say that ""bad things happening to good people"" or ""unanswered prayers"" or ""a lack of miracles"" are a result of God needing to build faith through the absence of blessings or evidence. God will give every human the opportunity to be righteous (again, even if they don't believe in Him) and faith in that sense might be tested during difficult times, but it increases because God gives reason and evidence to believe in His goodness *despite* the negative effects of sin in the world. 

Hopefully this makes sense. It's not exactly a majority view, but I do think it's well backed by the Bible.",7/23/22 12:20,7/23/22 12:20

They have a system of laws known as the Kanun that allows people to avenge their loved ones if they are killed by another person. The fundamental problem with this is that *every* death has some stakeholders. 

If the parents or spouse of a murder victim are allowed to brutally kill the convicted person, wouldn’t the family of the perpetrator also be upset about this? Who gets to decide whose “vengeance” is more important? In systems of blood feud, this pretty much leads to a cycle of ruthless killing that goes on for centuries because everyone wants to avenge their loved ones. I know that the system you’re proposing is a more “civilized” take on capital punishment or retributive justice, but it’s been tested out in many different ways throughout global history and it never works out, because the legal system needs limits on its penal power to prevent it from descending into chaos.

ihd6nxn,breckenridgeback,"&gt; but any argument with a correct conclusion reached through a flawed mechanism of argument the same conclusion can also be reached with an unflawed argument. because of this I will disregard any argument containing any flaws in logic with a response naming the type of fallacy it contains if it is blatantly obvious to contain an example of a textbook fallacy.

Fallacies - and their overzealous application - are not the be-all and end-all of logical reasoning.

&gt; biases and motivations are subservient to a logical argument and should be treated as such deal with the logic first biases and motivations second.

Actual conversations like the ones we're engaged in are subject to lots of interpretation between the argument itself and its formal structure.

For example:

* People should have freedom and rights (proposition P)
* It's important to guide children to correct behavior (proposition Q)
* Grounding children for a month is a good idea (proposition R)

You could easily write something like P -&gt; not R, or Q -&gt; R. But that's not really embedding the full logical connective tissue, because the statement P -&gt; not R requires a bunch of additional statements (namely that grounding children is a violation of freedom or rights), and in fact the fact that everyone already agrees proposition P isn't universal to begin with. Similarly, Q -&gt; R contains underlying statements like ""grounding children effectively changes their behavior"", and ignores the fact that Q itself is not absolute.

Reasoning in the real world tends to fail for those connective reasons as much or more than it does because of formal fallacies. Everyone agrees that \exists x | x \in S does not imply \forall x | x \in S, but that's not usually the point of failure. The choice of characterization matters a lot, as do the input facts.

&gt; of course im arguing my position from a minors point of view so I of course could directly serve to potentially benefit from the installment of a policy as describe in my ogp a bias I am aware of. unless that bias causes a falsehood or fallacy to be argued then it is managed and not relevant. 

I mean, it has - among other things, you've (falsely) claimed that the due process provisions of the Constitution apply to parental treatment.

&gt; coincidentally looking at a list of logical fallacy this fall nicely into an appeal to motive.

_frustrated head pounding into desk_

Your argument wasn't a logical one in the first place. You're arguing *from*, and as a result of, that motive. The motive is highly relevant.

&gt; bad faith. secondly arguing in kind with somebody who argues in bad faith is equivalent and thus net neutral gain or loss if you are more skilled with word than them then that is their personal problem. 

I'm not following this bit.

I don't think you're here in bad faith. Presenting a biased account that you don't *know* it biased isn't bad faith.

&gt; note the golden rule here treat people how you want to be treated and so if my parent argues in a condescending manner about anything than it is not morally wrong to do the same in the same time.

The golden rule does not say that retaliation is ethical. It's a guide for *your* actions, not someone else's. [Lex talionis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_for_an_eye) is ancient law, not modern ethics, and it is absolutely possible for *both* people in a conflict to be assholes.

&gt; this right here seems to be the core of the debate, the place of disagreement.

Well, yes.

&gt; I believe the necessary severity for any punishment to be given legal consideration is lower

Then I don't think you know the law very well. And I sincerely doubt this is a claim you've made any effort to verify. You spend any time skimming through Washington State family law and precedent? I'm betting not.

&gt; I believe this could be resolved quite simply, for groundings over 2 weeks an appeal is submitted requiring an unbiased third party(not necessarily a judge just an unbiased(unbiased as maximally possible) third party) and a jury of peers of the accused in low number maybe 10 or 12 maximum.

This is, to put it mildly, grossly impractical. (Also, ""jury of peers""? Are you trying to create juries of frustrated teenagers here?)

&gt; the number of groundings over 2 weeks would likely decrease as the process becomes more lengthy.

Yeah, and this is where we get at some of the heart of what you're about. You're not looking for due process, you're looking for extra burden to produce the outcome you want. Imagine, say, that there weren't any logical hassle to the parents in bringing such a ""case"", so that it creates no burden to imposing such punishments. Would that change your opinion of whether it's a good idea?

&gt; don't care was totally worth it. ie the consequences were less than the reward for me.

Then stop complaining about the consequences, lol.

&gt; I argued insufficiently here. I meant that everything said by authority should be examined not blanketly stated as unlikely because it was said by authority.

Such ""examination"" is more likely to produce a false positive from something you don't understand than a true positive where you identify a problem with it, at least in cases where the claim is coming from experts who have devoted proper study to the subject. This sort of reasoning is what leads to the 1 x 1 = 2 guy.

&gt; true but that assumes the conditions in which my policy works must be perfect and cannot be flawed to work.

Your policy would certainly not work within the current legal system.

Assuming that parents, on average, impose such a punishment 5 times through a child's upbringing (which I think is roughly what it would work out to if you looked at my own childhood? I don't have a great number, but let's use it to ballpark). Let's say the ""trial"" takes one work day, with a jury of 12 and some form of skilled-labor administrator (like a judge).

That is, per trial, something like 12 (jurors) \* $14.49 (WA state min wage) \* 8 hours (workday) = about $1,400. Judges are highly educated, but let's assume it's just a random administrator who makes, say, $50 an hour on average, that adds another $50 \* 8 = $400, for $1800 total. You've got administrative costs to file and keep track of results - those are hard to estimate, so I'm going to bake them into rounding up to $2000.

Times five times during a child's upbringing is $10,000 of extra rearing costs per child. There are [83,101](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/Documents/Pubs/422-099-2020-2010-VitalStatHighlights.pdf) live births in WA state per year, most of whom survive to adulthood, meaning that this amounts to an extra cost of around $800 million annually. That means you're devoting about 3% of WA state's *total* tax revenue to disputes over grounding children.

&gt; I mean all of the data, really like absolutely all of it.

You never, ever have that, even with the resources of major governments backing you. An approach that relies on data you never ever have is a *bad approach*. You need approaches that are robust to error.",7/23/22 13:43,7/23/22 13:43
ihdah7d,PreacherJudge,"&gt; I believe that some people have the capacity to genuinely truly believe things despite a lack of evidence or evidence to the contrary, and I believe some people don't.

This capacity is just called ""imagination.""  And yes, imaginative capacity absolutely varies across people.

...but I suspect you bristled when I called this imagination, and I think the reason might be in this ""truly believe"" term you used.  As in, the person has to imagine and then to forget they're using your imagination, or something like that.

But this was my point in asking about beliefs, because I think you might be smuggling a lot into the definition, and teasing all that out would be helpful.  So using your phrasing, I'll clarify I'm asking about what you mean when you say ""a trust that something is real.""  

Here's one specific aspect, in case it'll help communication.  Do you think beliefs *necessitate action*?  In other words, if I bite into the apple as if it was just an ordinary apple, then I couldn't have ""truly believed"" it was blue (and thus probably artificial)?",7/23/22 14:11,7/23/22 14:11

This means that your partner holds leverage over you (as you do over them), and you can't necessarily just ""laugh and say cool as if I wanna be with someone who doesn't want to be with me over a mild annoyance"".

ihe8ajg,Crazed_waffle_party,"I have a feeling you have a market oriented mindset. Perhaps you see relationships as a quasi-contract where both parties must gain value for it to be legitimized. If at some point in time a partner believes they are worse off in the relationship than they would be single, the contract becomes illegitimate; the frustrated partner has the moral high grounds to leave. 

But, the frustrated partner also has the freedom to negotiate. That is their choice, and considering the transaction has been delegitimized, it can be as seen charitable. They realize that if their bf/gf made some concession, both sides could reach mutual benefit again and continue the relationship. The ultimatum is not unethical, it's business! If a lover is unreasonable with their demands, they will lose value on the market of love. They are only hurting themselves, really. If their value drops too much, they'll have to reconsider their way of life. Thus, any problem with ultimatums are self correcting via market style forces.

But, relationships cannot be seen as impersonal transactions. The analogy breaks down once you introduce nuance. 

Fundamentally, all relationships are about shared life planning. Couples move in, share finances, and plan around each other. That is the base contract of a relationship. But that also means there is some vulnerability involved. One survey of 2002 adults found that 20% of women have delayed ending a relationship because of financial worries. In many cases, partners have sacrificed their professional prospects for their partners. A common example is when a mother will reduce her work obligations to take care of a child, so the father can focus more efforts on his professional success. In many of these cases, an ultimatum is nuanced because it can be perceived as an act of financial coercion. Financial coercion is clearly unethical.

So, someone cannot spam ultimatums unless they've considered the power dynamic and how much autonomy their partner really has. That makes it difficult to claim absolute morality while issuing an ultimatum. 

They can be reasonable, but an explanation is required that take precedence over power dynamics. The below is an example of how an ultimatum should go.

""Honey, I care deeply about you, but I got in this relationship because I thought it would mutually enhance our lives. However, your loud music keeps me up at night. It strains my ears and robs me of meditation. I love you, but your music is degrading my health. I am thinking of us, but I'm also thinking of my own self-preservation. If you cannot change your habits around music, I will have to leave for my own health. The relationship cannot make me happy when it also makes sick.""

In the above example, which parallels the one you provided, it is clear that the person has a defendable and rational reason. If someone were to make regular demands against their partner without justifying them, that could become abusive and fast.",7/23/22 18:32,7/23/22 18:32

iheig4a,woofzzz,"Every generation always has areas where they prosper and areas they are worse than their predecessors. 

However, ""overwhelmingly lower quality of life"", is vastly narrow sighted. Gen Z has some of the greatest quality of life in history: grew up with worlds knowledge at their finger tips, gender wage gaps are improving, gender/racial/etc... rights (is far better than it ever was, but still has a long way to go), access to far greater medicine, food, nutrition, and dietary options (vegan, gluten free, etc...), globalization and connectivity like never before, etc... 

The problems we have currently are real issues, but the problems of the past cannot be dismissed. The past isn't a great place either in numerous aspects: slavery, colonial powers, extreme inequality of race/gender, apartheid, literal war, lack of medical, etc... Imagine growing up during the great depression which extended to world war 2. Imagine your entire country is unemployed, and not knowing where their next meal would come from, then when your finally old enough to help your family, your at war in the front lines of a foreign country.

the only way i might be able to is say that millennials hit the dip harder, and you all might come out better than they did by some tiny fractional margin.   


Like, gen-x, did even better, in terms of wealth, than boomers did--and they're outpacing the wealth generation as a share of the population, faster than ANY generation ever has--it's astonishing.   


Compared to them, millennials are earning right now, about half of what they are. Adjusted for inflation, millennials are earning a little less than 1/4th the money (compared to buying power), that boomers did in the SAME JOBS in the 60's and 70's, at comparable ages.   


Millennials will NEVER--never, have an 'average age' for becoming a home owner, because more than half dont own one, and their ownership rate is going DOWN now that the oldest are 41.   


Gen X's wealth went up 65% in the pandemic--millennials went DOWN.   


Millennials control or own about 4% of the national wealth. When boomers were our age, they owned 26%.   


... so, considering how astonishing bad millennials have it, there's some SMALL chance your generation will do better ...   


Like, economists expect, by 2030, gen z to start flat out out-earning millennials. Which would be horrific--since millennials would be the age that gen-x is now, and gen x is earning double what millennials do (when you compare household incomes). That means millennials are predicted to NOT recover, while gen-z is on track to out-earn us.   


So--as far as economic power, gen-z may have the luck. They may be alive at the right time to see boomers pass, and property held by them (over half of it) to trickle into new hands. This is happening right NOW to the silent AND boomer generations as they die--but the wealth is passing to gen-x, not millennials (often the youngest children of boomers--or children of the oldest gen-x instead).   


It's possible that your generation, gen-z, can see the passing of the wealth from boomers and gen-x--and that it will skip millennials, while part of your generation uses the wealth of their millennial parents to supplement their life..   


So.. MAYBE.   


As far as climate, yeah, currently, you're fucked.   


However, i think in 10-15 years carbon capture, and 'clean fuel' is going to replace drilling for oil. We're going to see it catch like CRAZY--because it will be carbon negative fuel for cars, trucks, boats, planes--and the carbon PPM in the atmosphere will probably start to drop around the time your generation reaches 50... and the time millennials are dying in their old folks home from heat strokes when the AC goes out.   


Evidence for this is corporations like BP, Shell, Exxon, cutting their drilling and production goals by 40% or more by 2030--their peak drilling was in 2018/2019, and even NOW they're not upping that goal. They're preparing for carbon capture, and i think they see it coming, and are preparing for the transition--their old oil wells are going to become sites for capture..

This might well mean that Gen Z is to be the healthiest and longest-living generation in  history.

\&gt; Advances in political systems. I agree the US as well as many other nations are in danger of turning away from democracy and toward totalitarianism. However, at the same time, there are various grassroots movements (e.g., [Represent.US](https://Represent.US)) that seek to reform the more corrupt and dysfunctional aspect of government.   There may be a flowering of such movements, eventually leading not just to more democracy but to more functional forms of democracy than have ever existed.

ihinysz,O_Solid,"If you really think Republicans are all evil fascists that want to turn America into a Theocracy, you are part of the polarization my friend.

Not wanting to understand or having minimal empathy toward ""others"" is a direct path into self-righteousness. Both sides have valid and nutty points, but to put one side in a bin and call them wrong. it is a dangerous proposition.

Concerning Basic and Human rights, you should take a look at the actual Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

While you might disagree with the SCOTUS decision, it was not an outright ban, but the empowering of the states to decide, perhaps this even might be important in the future if the Federal government tries an outright ban.

Personally I think a very negative narrative is being spread, especially amongst the younger generations. There is a clear intent of using this to motivate and drive people into activism (sometimes with the right reasons), but a side effect is this feeling you have that everything is going so bad that nothing can be done, that's the dangerous part.

Truth be told, the world is always on the brink of chaos. The last 20 years were probably the best and most secure ever. Through the 60's to 80's there was the looming threat of nuclear war, imagine that. Living everyday in constant fear of  mutually assured Destruction.

Not to mention that you probably live on one of the best places on earth, with the best chances of financial success. Being born in America is basically EASY mode for life, try surviving in a third world country and you quickly learn how blessed and lucky you are, maybe even feel worst about what you have done with so much it was given to you.

Politics might feel really bad now, but trust me it is not as bad as it seems. USA is still a functioning democracy with periodical change of leadership. Maybe DEMs and REPs gotta go sometime and new parties rise to break the bipartisanship, but no rush, democracies take their sweet time to change, and that's is good, too fast and you have coup-d'etats every ten years.

About the weather, seriously is just a guessing game. Either way, human ingenuity has proven itself time-after-time as a powerful force. Ever heard about Thomas Robert Malthus ? He also thought the world was set for a disaster, convinced a lot of people, but 150 years later we are still striving.

On Wealth inequality, 1800's France was a hellish place compared to the USA today. Comparing these so different moments/countries is very tricky. I would take 100x an unequal place over a equal where everyone is dirt poor.

The dynamics of economic development have change so much, consider that now you don't need to own land, machines, workshops and etc to be productive and or inventive. Owning land used to be discretionary, only the King/State could allow you to own, even if you had the money for it. Setting up a factory workshop used to cost TONS of money, in loans, only given to a few selected ones. The advent of computers and internet changed the game completely, even if you get dealt a shitty hand in life, there is a good chance you can improve it.

ihjrczb,timberlin,"Pilot, here, so I'll see what I can do.....

**Lack of Control**

I can absolutely empathize with this feeling.  What I can say are the individuals in control of a commercial airliner are some of the most experienced aviators on the planet who have undergone years of rigorous training to get to the point that you cross paths.  They are significantly more skilled at operating their machinery than the average driver out on the road.  For whatever reason, driving an automobile doesn't garner the fear and respect it should, so everyone takes it for granted.  Think of how many distracted drivers there are out on the road, who at any time can slam into your car with no chance for reaction on your end.  Though you are controlling YOUR car, you are not controlling theirs, so in a very practical sense, you are not nearly in as much control of your fate as you might prefer to be.  A question I would ask you though, is do you feel the same discomfort riding passenger in an automobile as you do a plane?

**Flying in Inclement Weather**

Your concern is completely warranted as severe weather can very easily take a plane down and is often a root cause in aviation mishaps; however, for that reason, it is equally a concern for those flying the plane.  Before every flight, I can assure you that your pilot has thoroughly reviewed the forecast throughout the route of flight, as well as over a wide time range to account for delays.  If too dangerous and unable to avoid this weather, aircrews may alter the route of flight, amend take-off windows to slip into a safer line, or choose altogether to not enter into a region of severe weather.  If this doesn't put your mind at ease, commercial airlines have incredibly sophisticated onboard weather radars to provide real-time updates as the flight progresses.  This is further backed up by ground weather radar systems that are relayed up to the pilot by Air Traffic Control (ATC) to further expand the picture to the pilots.  On the rare occasion that these systems are not able to provide adequate information, pilots will often report unexpected conditions to ATC through something called a PIREP (pilot report), so this information can be relayed to other aircraft in the area.  Lastly, and most importantly, don't discount eyeballs and experience.  With the thousands of hours under their belts, commercial pilots are not stupid and will not fly directly into a cumulonimbus that they see off the nose, regardless of what a radar picture says.

**Airborne Emergencies**

This is something I would say should be the furthest from your worries.  The image of flaming aviation wreckage triggers really visceral emotions deep within nearly everyone.  I won't continue to pound the drum of statistics in this regard, but you need to understand that catastrophic aviation emergencies are effectively a rounding error.   Safety is paramount in everything we do in aviation.  If there is an accident, panels of experts deep dive into every root cause, this information is processed, and then it is presented to the larger aviation community.  From there, we study it extensively, learn from those mistakes, aligning policy, design, and training to prevent similar mistakes from occurring again.  Because of this culture, our processes for handling emergencies are well laid out.  Aircraft are equipped with countless sensors and automation to attempt prevent failures altogether, but at a minimum, present this information quickly to the pilots to act.  Aircraft undergo maintenance and inspections at a much more frequent clip than anything you have experienced with automobiles.  On top of this, pilots are trained extensively on their equipment and we have access to thousands of pages of technical documentation and checklists in the air to help us work through any equipment failures.  I don't say this to scare you, but it is very likely that you have been on a flight with an emergency, but the safety redundancies in design and well laid out procedural guidance quickly and quietly solved the problems with you being none the wiser.  On the chance that none of this fixes the issue and a expedited landing needs to occur, emergency aircraft have complete priority in the air.  ATC opens the Red Sea, pushing any potential conflicts in the air out of the way to minimize air time for the emergency aircraft.

ihk2mwe,rollingForInitiative,"I live in Sweden and I'm a software developer. I'm quite sure that if I lived in the US, I would have more money over at the end of the day.

But I wouldn't want to live there anyway. In Sweden, I'll have access to healthcare regardless of my job. If I want to take a job at a small company - or even if I become unemployed - I'll never have to pay more than like $30 to go to the ER and have whatever treatments required for whatever happened. I'll never have to pay more than $120 for healthcare per year *at all*, because that's the maximum you pay. Nor will I have to witness the struggles of friends and family who just cannot afford it.

I could come down with diabetes, and know that I will get insulin for free. If I got HIV, I'd get HIV meds for free.

I'm not planning on having children, but if I did, I wouldn't have to save money for their college fund, because education doesn't cost anything.

I also know that regardless of where I work, I will always be legally entitled to 25 paid vacation days per year, and a legal right to 11 hours of consecutive daily rest and 36 hours of consecutive weekly rest. I'll have unlimited sick days as well.

And regardless of where I work, there's always a hard cap on how much ordered overtime you can work - for instance, never more than an average of 48 hours over 4 weeks, unless there's some kind of force majeure (like a pandemic for healthcare workers).

And even though my salary is lower than in the US, I make significantly more than the median income. So much more that I can work at reduced hours, have a day off every other week, and *still* make much more than the median salary.

Also, I don't even have a driver's license, which seems to be something that you much more frequently need in the US than here.

&gt;Btw what is the point of having so much free weeks in a year while your wage will not allow you to travel as much and as hard as americans do in a few days

Most Swedes do? I've been abroad twice in the last two months. A lot of people go abroad in the Summer, to places like Spain or Greece. Going abroad 1-3 per year is super common among ""professionals"".

And that doesn't even cover domestic travel. A lot of people have summer homes in the countryside where they'll spend their vacations. Or they'll just hang around at home. Since most people use most of their vacation in the summer, you'll usually have time off at the same time as friends. So you can go on road trips, go swimming, do BBQ's or just hang around chilling.

And if you're actually short on money - maybe you're a student - you can travel across Europe much cheaper than travelling to the other side of the world. But your post is about people who have money, and people who have money can travel.

ihkwrtb,chemguy216,"I’m not going to try to convince that most or all religious communities are bad, but I ask, how well do you know what those outside of your religious community but within the local community feel about the religious ones?

This is usually difficult for people within the in-group to see properly. For example, when I was in middle school, I had shared with some friends that I was an atheist. Most of the folks in my hometown are Christians, so when some of my peers heard that, they wanted to try to save me. They weren’t “rude” about it, but as an inherent cultural difference, I personally take attempts to “save me” as insulting.

The fact is that a lot of people have not-so-great opinions about religious people and religions because of personal experiences they’ve had. My public high school fought same sex prom dates and only dropped it after the second time they got sued by the ACLU. I had a college acquaintance who had a shit time in her small town schools because she’s a lesbian and wasn’t religious. She was basically treated like a harlot because she wasn’t sufficiently in line with God. She even got the chance deal with her school failing to address sexual harassment because they basically blamed her for some dude’s actions. I’ve had randos feel the need to tell me and my boyfriend that God doesn’t approve of us in some shape or fashion.

So what I want you to consider is that maybe your community was good, but you should not speak for communities you’re not part of. You may know your religious community where you grew up, but folks from the same religion in a different town could be the very people you want to separate yourself from. Additionally, maybe your community didn’t serve some folks in out-groups as much as you think they did (not saying this is the case, but I’m giving you food for thought).",7/25/22 7:19,7/25/22 7:19

* How many clergy speak of hatred and intolerance instead of peace and forgiveness and loving the stranger?

My wife and I looked into foster/adoption in the late 2000's. Based on a supreme court decision made last year, if we apply to a Christian run foster agency that is acting under government contract to our city, they can turn us away as ""unfit"" for simply being a different religion. Nevermind that the child we may be interested in can be of our religion since again, they are acting on behalf of the city. Fun little factoid I learned while my wife and I were looking from a friend that more successfully navigate the system. There are currently \~400k kids in foster care, there are approximately \~380k churches in the US. If one family from every church took a kid or family out of the foster system, we would have no kids in foster.

I think the issue is that not all churches fulfill the same role.  Mega churches don't always offer that unconditional support.

There was [a segment on the This American Life podcast](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/756/but-i-did-everything-right) about a woman who had 2 unviable pregnancies.  For the first, pregnancy, her conservative megachurch was very supportive of her and gave her a platform to speak.  On the second one, she was kind of shut out.  

&gt;""I did, many times, reach out to our church and say, hey, Sanctity of Life Sunday is coming up. I would be happy to speak out, and this is my story. And I sent that to our head pastor and many of the other pastors, and it was never brought up or answered. It was just amazing to me that I had been through this twice. I could go up there and speak about it. And I was in the church. I was a member of the church, and they never asked me to.""

&gt;Rebecca believes she wasn't given a chance to speak because only a certain kind of woman gets featured at Sanctity of Life Sunday, the woman who chose life, sometimes against doctor's advice, and certainly against all odds, and God rewarded her for her faith.

&gt;She was given some heart-wrenching diagnosis, but her baby was born completely fine. Or as she was told her son would have severe disabilities, but here he is at church, thriving as an adult. With Cora, Rebecca easily fit into this archetype. Her church community rallied around her with their prayers and their presence. And she did get her redemption story in a way, with Lydia arriving so soon after Cora's death, and Aben's adoption not too long after that. But now, Rebecca felt like her life no longer fit a clean redemption storyline.

&gt;""I can't imagine going up there at the front of the church saying, this is what happened, and then my baby died. And then it was really hard, and I was really depressed and mad at God. They didn't want to be told that it was hard. They wanted to hear me, when I was with Cora saying, I had hope, and I was OK. But I think my grief after Layla was way more authentic than it was after Cora. And people felt uncomfortable about that.""

My parents were separated and she begged him to let her help him that they could figure it out. My dad said that it was a trick and pulled the trigger on the phone with her.

I went to therapy and what was making me want to die my therapist painted the picture like it was totally normal and nothing to be ashamed of. Suicidal people are not in their right minds.

I'd certainly swap if I could snap my fingers, but that shit is scary and expensive and it can't give me the thing I'd most care about anyway (the ability to carry children).

But anyway. By the definition you give, certainly most trans people are dysphoric. I don't know if all of them are. It doesn't seem totally implausible to me that someone could feel just the positive stuff and not the negative, I guess? I don't know that it really matters that much, and I'd rather err on the side of being accepting in cases where I think there's a strong bias toward not.

I certainly wasn't very dysphoric relative to the average trans person, in that it wasn't like I couldn't look at my body in the mirror or anything. It was just a bummer and I was so happy to see it change.

ihnd70o,laconicflow,"I agree with you on number three. The democrats are listening to their most radical voices on cultural and social issues, and so they say silly inanities like ""pregnant men,"" and lose votes from the right of that position. That overreach on social issues is allowing  Republicans to paint democrats as being radical on social issues, as though the most radical left-wing opinions  is the stance of the democratic party, which it isn't. 

I disagree with you on No. 2. Abortion rights  have a majority of support in all the polling I've seen. The support isn't for totally unrestricted abortion, but, abortion with some limits on it is the majority position, Abortion only in cases of rape and incest is not the majority position. 

A democrat in a red area may benifit from being pro-life, but it depends on where that person is running, so as a local tactic, I agree, but as a matter of national policy the party should stay pro choice, my bet is the abortion issue is a good one for democrats going into November and beyond.

  
I half agree with you on number I. Tellig people that they supported Nazi's last election is not the way to get them to vote for you. On the other hand, Trump attempted a coup, and, to me acted as a wanabee authoritarian, we have the courage of men and women and the sgtrength of our constitution to thank for his coup attempt failing. Also, moderate Republicans are sort of an endangered species, and the left heaps praise upon them these days. 

In my opinion a large part of the Republican party is playing footsy with a movement that is anti-democratic, and I don't mean democeratic party, I mean anti-democracy, which is very bad, and the democrats and the moderate Republicans should say that, because not saying it when it is true is enabling it. 

The issue is that, as a party you have to say things to keep the people who voted for you last time, and to get more people next time, and its a narrow road to walk.


I would also say that a lot of this has to do with where you run. Stuff that seems overly liberal to you and me will play well in very liberal area's.

Right now, the US is experiencing the highest inflation rate we've seen since the 80s, so the economy's both doing poorly and doing poorly in a very salient way; that's going to make midterms bad for democrats basically no matter what messaging they go with.

There's a fairly broad range of options on abortion policy between 'only rape, incest, and medical necessity' and 'universally'; in particular, there are a decent number of people who support abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy, but not later on.

Secondly...how would the exception for rape or incest even work? Would you insist on a conviction before the abortion? Because it is incredibly unlikely that a person gets arrested, tried, and convicted in 9 months, especially if the victim doesn't recognize their attacker. And if you don't, well, I think you'll find the rate of rape claims with dubious evidence will skyrocket. What happens if someone gets an abortion and then it turns out to have been consensual sex? Are we going to imprison that person? What happens when we accidentally imprison a rape victim for the crime of having an abortion after being raped?

ihnvsvw,OrdinaryOk5247,"Eugenics is always a bad idea. I have objections to it on the basis that every life is worthwhile, even those touched by the ""horrible"" disabilities you refer to. Their lived are not just constant suffering, their lives are complicated and worthwhile things. Ask them about it sometime. Disabled people are often quite happy, and even if they were not, its no one else's business whether or not disabled people are allowed to exist.

Even beyond that, your idea of a ""limited"" eugenics is still a fantasy and a mistake. Enabling a hierarchical structure with the ability to decide who deserves to reproduce and who does not will invariably end in tragedy and great evil. In your soft-eugenics, who gets to decide which people get to reproduce? The government? Do you trust the government, any government, to make consistently smart and informed decisions about who lives and dies, or who gets to reproduce?

No eugenics are moral eugenics. Even if you claim you want only a limited eugenics which eliminate painful conditions, enabling any authority with the power to decide who gets to reproduce and who doesn't, who gets to exist and who doesn't, invariably ends in fascist tendencies.

What gives a bunch of able-bodied people the right and authority to decide what disabilities qualify for this? What gives you or I the right to say ""I don't think that this class of person should exist, for the protection of everyone.""? Humanity is not exactly struggling-- there are 7 Billion of us. We have no need to only invest all of our resources into the ""strongest"" as determined by a bunch of folks on reddit. 

Okay, so really quick, lets talk about Buck v. Bell. [Buck v. Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_v._Bell) was the SCOTUS case in the 1927 where the forced sterilization of the ""feeble minded"" was permitted. This case has never been overturned. In the case, Carrie Buck was ordered sterilized for being ""mentally feeble."" As it turns out, Nuck had actually been institutionalized to cover up her rape at the hands of her adopted mother's nephew. She was never mentally feeble at all. SCOTUS still upheld her sterilization for the ""health and safety of the nation."" One by one, all the states repealed their laws that allowed for such sterilizations. Nazis, however, cited Buck v. Bell in their defense at the Nuremberg Trials.

If you allow any eugenics, you are creating thousands of Carrie Bucks at a minimum. Many, many people will be wrongfully harmed, not just because eugenics is wrong, but because governments are *really* bad at getting it right. For example, roughly 4-6% of American prisoners are believed to be innocent. If our justice system can accidentally and wrongfully limit the right of liberty for 1 in 20 people, what makes you think that we'll be any more competent at limiting the right of reproduction?",7/25/22 19:17,7/25/22 19:17

ihoktz3,StoicInTheCentre,"Australian here. As a disclaimer, I 100% sympathise with you - making animals suffer to try and un-fuck a human mistake is really rough, and I wish there was another way. That being said, let's go point-by-point:

&gt;...read that neuter/spaying cats then releasing them isn’t a good option because they can still kill birds after they’re released. So, why don’t they simply not release the cats?  
&gt;  
&gt;My first idea: they build huge enclosures (almost like a zoo) where the cats can live the rest of their days out in peace (while not hurting birds). The Australian government might even make some money doing this. Because I would assuming having a cat zoo would bring in a lot of visitors. Additionally, they could make it where people can adopt the cats. Imagine all the international tourists who go to the cat zoo while visiting Australia, fall in love with a cat, and take it back home.

You've already acknowledged that the idea is a stretch, but I want to impress upon you just how much of a stretch it is to keep all the animals alive, fed and accommodated somewhere while you wait for them to die a natural death. According to the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, The Environment and Water (DCCEEW), there are 2.1 - 6.3 **million** feral cats in Australia. Just think about that number for a moment. How would you go about accommodating them? Cats are solitary predators - dominant male cats may have territories of up to 8 km2, while the territories of females are smaller and may even be halved while kittens are being reared. If you're goal is to be humane, I assume you wouldn't want to pack them in like factory-farmed animals, so where do we even get the space? Much less the food, water, veterinary staff, support staff, etc.? I think we can agree that this is not a feasible option, so let's move to:

&gt;Potentially they could send the cats to other countries, or declaw the cats, or build enclosures to protect the birds?

Again, according to DCCEEW:

&gt;Feral cats threaten the survival of over 100 native species in Australia. They have caused the extinction of some ground-dwelling birds and small to medium-sized mammals. They are a major cause of decline for many land-based endangered animals such as the bilby, bandicoot, bettong and numbat.

And this article from the Smithsonian [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/australias-cats-kill-two-billion-animals-annually-180977235/](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/australias-cats-kill-two-billion-animals-annually-180977235/) leads with:

&gt;Australia’s Cats Kill Two Billion Animals Annually

There is no stopping these creatures. They are the perfect predator in Australia, with it's lack of large predatory mammals and preponderance of endangered, small marsupials, it's almost like they're purpose-built to cause mass-extinctions.

I don't like the method any more than you do. But at this stage, it's a necessary evil.

Edit: The DCCEEW actually has a pretty comprehensive resource on the topic, which goes in to far more detail than I ever could.

We also still are in a society where trans women are drastically shamed and discriminated against in dating especially if they have a penis becuse “they can’t be a women with a penis” this porn  genre is a reminder and breeding ground of this mentality.",7/26/22 1:49,7/26/22 1:49
ihoy39f,DouglerK,"Futanari is arguably fetishization. Hentai is full of fetishes.

I'm not sure what crowds you roll with where talking about other hentai fetishes don't offend people but ""futa"" or futanari does. 

Basically the times where it is not going to be offensive is actually quite exceptional. You said yourself you wouldn't say it in the company of those who find it offensive. That would be 99% of the time with everyone except certain individuals. Hentai in general is going to be an offensive topic most of the time. 

Even with just the word in particular. The fact that you recognize that you need to be discretionary with the use of the word means that it's offensive enough to warrant that discretion. A word being offensive really comes down to how many people actually find it offensive and how often it's use actually affects them. The latter might not be so relevant here but for the former even you acknowledge there are enough people who do find it offensive to warrant discrection. 

So if you're talking to other people about your fetishes who also don't find futa to be offensive then go ahead and say it. You couldn't be stopped. Nobody would even know. Any offensive word can be said i secret or away from the people it offends.

 It is also specifically a porn term. If you aren't having a porn conversation then it would be quote offensive to describe someone or something in porn terms.

Also just a second much less complicated thought. Futa is short for Futanari. Tranny is short for transexual. Tranny is pretty offensive. Transsexual is not so offensive. You think something similar is going on with ""Futa"" and the specific relationship to fetish material being the worst representation of it? Futanari is ""dual form"" and androgyny and hermaphroditism. ""Futa"" is a porn fetish. 

Similarly hermaphrodite is a politically incorrect word to use sometimes. Hermaphrositism is a specific disorder. In (especially hentai) porn the subjects are made up. Artists can draw them as whatever their fetish wants them to be. They are some kind of fetishized ideal. They aren't real people. In reality people are much more complicated. Hermaphroditism as depicted in porn is rare compared to what real people with intersection conditions deal with.

It is more frequently used as a pornographic sorting/genre tag for when Japanese illustrated pornography contains one or more characters that present as women and have some set of male sex organs. Weebs and other online-populations then take this term and start applying it to real trans people.

This is sexualizing, fetishizing, and objectifying trans people, which is what makes the word offensive. You seem to already understand this, so what you are missing is just that words are not intrinsically meaningful in and of themselves.",7/26/22 2:09,7/26/22 2:09

ihs5t6d,breckenridgeback,"Okay I thought this was a trans thread but I guess this is a depression thread. Cool, I can roll with that.

&gt; One of the sexual disorders they told me about was just that: that they are asexual [in the general sense].

Being asexual is not a disorder. Some people just don't feel much or any sexual attraction.

Now, it's true that hormone treatments can temporarily kill libido - I don't think I had a sexual thought for something like six months when I had first started hormones - but that's distinct from being asexual.

The fact that hormones kill libido doesn't mean your friend *isn't* ace, though.

&gt; They've always been seen I hate to say now in hindsight as a 'fussy eater', and have recently been diagnosed with an eating disorder that involves limitations of varieties of foods.

This sounds, to me, like something vaguely autism-spectrum-y. It's pretty common for people on the spectrum to be picky, and trans people are on the spectrum at rates far higher than the general public (exactly why that is isn't known).

&gt; When one isn't brought up well as a child it might manifest in between childhood and young-adulthood as a thing that they utilise as a means of compensation. One of the points of my above asexual digression is that it's also is another 'label' that's unorthodox and interesting, which is the common denominator between all the mental complications this person suffers from, whether professionally diagnosed or self-accounted. My point isn't that kids and young adults are making it all up for attention (KEY THING HERE: THEY ARE NOT), but rather that these titles that they use and ultimately become diagnosed with are things that their id has subconsciously driven them into not wanting to abandon for fear of being rejected for being plain.

This is kind of unfalsifiable, but it is also a very common (wrong) response to people dealing with various forms of mental illness.

&gt; Otherwise, realistically, what are the odds of a person (the same as who I've been writing about) being diagnosed with several disorders

High. Those conditions are heavily correlated with one another, and being trans screws a whole lot of stuff up until one can access transition care (which dramatically reduces rates of e.g. depression).

&gt; The therapists, instead of legitemately ridding them of it, only advance it.

Treating a condition isn't ""advancing"" it.

&gt; This person has had (on their account) long-term depression easily caused by nutritional deficiencies (such as magnesium), and it, now being clinically diagnosed, lately has worsened because of unnatural hormone levels from excess oestrogen

Estrogen actually has weak antidepressant effects, so if anything that should be helping (somewhat aside from transitioning helping too).

&gt; and on top of that will be given antidepressants which makes psychiatric disorders even worse

...no. Antidepressants don't ""make psychiatric disorders even worse"". Speaking as someone who is alive today and far more mentally healthy because of being on a working one even briefly, I can say that with some personal conviction. But also like...what, you think there's a whole field that exists purely to give you a drug that actively hurts you? Do you think every therapist in the world is some mad scientist cackling in their evil lair or something?

&gt; and absolutely no benefit has been given to the client here except the superficial satisfaction that they have a slightly altered appearance and voice.

Transition was far more than ""superficial satisfaction"" for me, and it is for most trans people. I am way, way, WAY happier and healthier post-transition and (for unrelated reasons) post-care-for-depression than I have been at any other point in my life, to the point that it feels like every second before those things was just a waste when I could've been feeling better all along.

&gt; A therapist's job shouldn't be to prescribe pills to people with depression, but rather find the root cause of it (whether internal or external), and deal with it on that basis alone.

Well, one, depression is somewhat self-sustaining even without whatever triggered it, and for two, the root cause is somewhat biological, and antidepressants are how you address that root cause.

&gt; It should also be their job to rather promote habits and practices that contribute to the ridding of the illness, not dosages of artificial numbness of it.

They do. That's...kind of the whole point of therapy, and psychiatric meds and therapy are known to work better together than either of them does alone. Meds give you some strength to fight back, and therapy shows you where to best direct that energy.

Okay, and how do you know this with any certainty?

And if their libido comes back later...so what? No harm done.

&gt; When the asexuality thing is a clear asset of this concept, it has to be true to some degree.

I don't think you can be confident that it is, though.

&gt; Being given a pill that temporarily numbs a condition and that if you abandon it makes the condition worse in principle advances the condition. It being called a 'treatment' is just another way that it's misleading.

I mean, even if depression weren't self-reinforcing (which it is), we absolutely do treat symptoms of many illnesses just to help people feel better. And since not being in pain really helps with being able to take action, it's not just to feel better, either.

As an example, when I had surgery, I was told I needed to get up and move around frequently to ensure it healed properly. They also gave me painkillers so it wouldn't hurt like all hell to do that. The painkillers contributed to my ability to try to heal properly, just like antidepressants help a depressed person to get enough energy to start doing the things they need to do to break the cycle.

&gt; High estrogen equals lowered test. And low test has strong 'depressant' effects that can outweigh oestrogen's weak antidepressant effects.

Not in a trans woman, it doesn't.

&gt; Is it profitable for the producers and suppliers? Does it make some people dependent on it? I don't see why it's not so plausible a thought.

This would require an absolutely massive conspiracy full of people who aren't financially motivated. Even if they *were* financially motivated, most people don't spend years going into a field to try to help people just to make a quick buck exploiting them. Yes, there are exceptions, but your theory would require virtually everyone in the entire field to be evil.

Like, why is it easier for you to believe in a conspiracy of thousands of people than to believe that, you know, you're wrong about what treatments work in an area where you have no expertise?

&gt; That's good for you, but the point of that wasn't to be a denunciation of the trans identity, but rather the expose what I believe is misleading about the whole process, the treatment of the whole thing.

And what is it you think is misleading?

&gt; Not necessarily and not all the time. Loneliness can be a cause of depression, and that's not even somewhat biological.

Depression is a state of your brain. Whether that state is initially created by external circumstances (as it was in my case) or not doesn't make it any less of an internal problem. The proximate trigger for my depression was being super poor, but it didn't go away just because I stopped being poor - I kept having the same thoughts and same struggles even after the initial cause was gone.

Or, to put it another way: smoking causes lung cancer, but that doesn't mean you can just stop smoking and your cancer will be cured. The cancer is a new, self-sustained thing that exists independently of the smoking. Your claims here are something like ""um, chemo isn't addressing the root cause"" - no, but it's addressing the problem right now.

&gt; It would be a decent proposition in my opinion to suggest that not only is the depression caused by greater disorders, but also malnutrition.

I don't know about your friend, but the very first thing my doctor did was blood tests to check for exactly this. (And for other things like hypothyroidism.)",7/26/22 17:29,7/26/22 17:29
ihsihpe,Bamboozle_,"His conclusion is thus:

&gt; In conclusion, despite numerous challenges to studying the issues addressed herein, this article highlights a few key points about the use, impacts, and regulation of high-capacity semiautomatic weapons as they pertain to the problem of mass shootings in the United States. LCM firearms are used in between 20% and 58% of all firearm mass murders, and they are used in a particularly high share of public mass shootings. Mass shootings perpetrated with LCM firearms result in substantially more fatalities and injuries than do attacks with other firearms, and these differences are particularly pronounced for nonfatal gunshot injuries. Quantifying the unique contribution of LCM firearms to these outcomes with greater precision, independently of or in interaction with offender and situational characteristics, will require further and more sophisticated study. Notwithstanding, extrapolations from available data imply that tighter regulation of high-capacity firearms could potentially reduce mass shooting fatalities by 11% to 15% and total fatal and nonfatal injuries from these attacks by one quarter, with larger impacts for public mass shootings. For reasons discussed, actual impacts from LCM regulation seem likely to be lower, although some aggregate-level studies raise the possibility of larger effects. Nonetheless, these figures are high enough to suggest that tighter regulation of high-capacity semiautomatic weaponry—and restriction of LCMs in particular—is one policy measure that can contribute meaningfully to reducing deaths and injuries from mass shootings. Effects may be modest and gradual, however, depending on the form of those regulations.

&gt; **The federal AW–LCM ban of 1994 had important exemptions and loopholes that limited its impacts in the short run. Its expiration in 2004, however, was followed by an upswing in mass shootings with high-capacity semiautomatics that has contributed to more severe incidents with higher fatalities and injuries.** Policy makers who wish to reinstate a new version of the federal ban should give careful consideration to any grandfathering provisions in future legislation. Assessing the political and practical difficulties of registering all AWs and LCMs or establishing turn-in or buyback programs for them is beyond the scope of this article.  Policy makers should note, however, that it may take many years to attain substantial reductions in crimes committed with banned guns and/or magazines if a new law exempts the existing stock, which has likely grown considerably since the time of the original ban. Policies regarding exemptions must also explicitly address the status of imported guns and magazines.

&gt; In the meantime, further research is needed on the implementation and effects of state restrictions on AWs and LCMs (and perhaps those at the local level as well). Although some studies indicate that mass shootings are lower in states with these laws (and LCM bans in particular), more evidence is needed to show definitively that these laws reduce crimes with LCM firearms and, in turn, reduce mass shootings and other gunshot victimizations. Further research is also needed to determine whether the effectiveness of these laws varies based on their specific provisions.

&gt; The conclusions offered here are also subject to various caveats regarding the current state of data and research on mass shootings. Better data collection systems are needed to track mass shootings and document the features of these incidents, including the type of weaponry used. There is also a need for more studies that analyze the dynamics and outcomes of attacks with different types of guns and magazines. Such studies would help to refine our understanding of how changes in the use of high-capacity semiautomatics affect the incidence and severity of mass shootings. This essay has also focused on firearm mass murders resulting in four or more deaths. As data become more widely available for tracking multiple victim shootings, studies using different definitions of mass shootings (e.g., based on total injury counts) could provide a wider perspective on how the use and regulation of LCM firearms affect mass violence. Finally, future studies will also need to further assess whether firearm restrictions, including those on AWs and LCMs, lead to substitution of other methods in attempts to inflict mass casualty events (and with what results).

&gt; In closing, restrictions on AWs and LCMs are not a complete solution for the problem of mass shootings or public mass shootings more specifically. Nonetheless, they are modest policy measures that can likely help to reduce the incidence and severity of mass shootings over time. Given the high social costs of murders and shootings these laws could produce substantial savings for society even if their effects on mass shootings are modest.

I am not going to discuss the possible effectiveness of the new ban, or its potential effects on the Democrats' election prospects, just wanted to point out that the conclusion in the 2004 report is more nuanced and highlight that updated data is always important.",7/26/22 17:58,7/26/22 17:58

ihsw0xo,Purple171717,"Firstly, I'd like to bring up I wouldn't say dictionary definitions are how we typically explain simpler concepts like sandwich, women, man, or human. I don't recall ever being taught exactly what a sandwich was or looking that word up in the dictionary, I'm pretty sure concepts such as that were taught by people pointing at pictures and saying things like ""this is a sandwich and this is not"" but thats as far as I'll expand on that right now as I feel this definition argument is growing repetitive and isn't really going anywhere. As for the concept of gender euphoria, I'd be happy to expand on that. It's really something fairly simply, its the term used to refer to the happiness felt by expressing the gender identity which you can identify with. Its hard to be mire specific than that as what causes gender euphoria varies from person to person and identity to identity. It can come from simple things like wearing gender affirming clothing or using gender affirming pronouns or it can come from slightly more drastic things like hormones and surgery. Every person who identifies as anything under the trans umbrella feels some kind of gender euphoria when they do certain gender affirming things (as far as I know anyways), whereas not everyone under that umbrella feels the gender dysphoria typically associated with being trans. Though not an expert on the subject, I'm fairly certain the reason its defined by euphoria rather than dysphoria is not only because of the identities mentioned in my previous comment but also because a cis person expressing their gender identity in a way besides the one assigned at birth wouldn't feel that euphoria, whereas a trans person would feel euphoria even if they've never felt dysphoria before. I hope that helps to explain it as thats the best I can do with a general overview.

But I want to avoid even the bare minimum risk of hurting a human with a personality/consciousness/soul. That means if they have the bare minimum structures needed to have thoughts, I wouldn’t abort. That takes about 5-6 months. There’s a few weeks of variation because sperm can live in a woman for a while, nuances of the ovulation cycle, tiny differences in rates of development between fetuses, etc.

This doesn’t apply to all fetuses. Many have major developmental defects that prevent them from ever developing upper brain structures. They can be aborted well after 6 months. If they aren’t, they’ll be stillborn. Furthermore, sometimes fetuses develop brains, but it ends up being a life of mother vs. life of baby and mother trade off. I’d consider this to be a horrible circumstance that’s similar to a child dying in a car crash. It’s just a sad part of life. Lastly, it can be either a mother or baby trade off. Then it’s the trolley problem. 

The great thing about this is that the early abortion technique basically stops the fetus from developing, thereby killing it. There is a 0 percent chance a 4 month fetus has the upper brain structures to house a consciousness/personality/soul. The later 5-6 month method is to just induce labor and give birth to the fetus. If it survives, it reached the point of developing upper brain structures and can be put up for adoption. If it is stillborn, it never developed the upper brain structures in the first place.

Ultimately, modern abortion techniques mean there’s a 0 percent chance of ever harming a fetus with the bare minimum brain structures to house a consciousness/personality/soul. Even a 0.00001% chance would be unacceptable. But it’s 0% unless you think all human cells are sacred, not just the ones capable of consciousness.

However, here's where you jump off a big old cliff:

&gt;I also don’t think that minors should be allowed to take puberty blockers, as the side effects can be permanent vision loss and IIH. IIH also has increased risks for other problems, like depression, suicide

This is an absurd position for you to take. I'm not trying to be a jerk, just pointing out that you've set up a glaringly false dichotomy. You're saying that children shouldn't be allowed to make choices that irrevocably affect their bodies -- fine, but how on earth is *going through puberty* ***not*** *an irreversible change on their body?*

Let's lay it out:

1. **Among adults who self-identify as transgender, gender affirming therapies are highly effective and achieve a substantial reduction in rates of suicide and self-harm.** This is non-controversial; it's the accepted medical position. Unless you believe that the American Medical Association, Psychological Association, Pediatric Association, National Institute of Health and World Health Organization have all failed to review the literature and make an informed, patient-oriented choice, I shouldn't have to prove this to you.
2. **These therapies correct, largely, for the effects of puberty.** While bottom surgery specifically does not, all the other surgical interventions are responses to puberty.

ihwibss,grimorg80,"Alright, so if you believe it's the result of human choice, then you should be more inquisitive and inform yourself on the actual mechanics of modern economies. 

To make it short: none of the monetary scarcity the governments with a fiat currency (like the US and the UK) is real. Money is not scarce, and in fact, central banks must pay whatever their respective governments instruct them to. Money must be generated before it can be regained with tax. No money spent, no taxation. Inflation is about maintaing a balance between money taxed back and savings. When money is in circulation, it multiplies the tax coming back. When it goes towards only 1% of the population, it dies. 

Inflation is run by never before seen profits for shareholders. The wealth generated is extracted from the working class, if not injected by the state. 

That's simple modern economics since abandoned the gold standard. Nothing more, nothing less. 

People at the top, the richest, who make money through the financial markets, count on people not realising that money is indeed not scarce. Banks wouldn't be able to ask for a higher interest, and eventually own half a country via asset seizing.

It's not conspiratorial. It's the sad reality.

This form of capitalism started generating wealth in a cycle that was supposed to last forever. People at the top are making more money than ever. Way above inflation. 

It's only human to imagine a response from the working class, which is currently asked to take the brunt of the supply issues. 

If you understand those economic concepts, then you have to concede that the most logical response would be advocate for change.",7/27/22 13:51,7/27/22 13:51

Game Pass makes this point moot, both on PC and consoles. I haven't bought a game in 2 years.

&gt; PCs allow you to cusomize your gaming experience to a much larger degree. For some reason console games usually have a severly limited settings menu compared to PC, not only relating to graphics settings but also chaging the button mapping.

ihwp0w2,budlejari,"&gt; You can also get PCs for much less than consoles if you have a tight budget.

Cheap PCs do not do well with heavy games that need a lot of resources. They just don't. I play the Sims on a pretty high spec PC that has a lot of custom content and mods. A low end laptop will set itself on fire and scream as it burns if I tried to play on it. Low end PCs, as the suggestion says, are low end. They are not intended to take the strain of heavy gaming and thus, if you want to PC game, you have to pay the price. My PC was $1500. I am not a builder, I cannot build my own so I had to pay the price to have someone else do it for me. I can get a PS5 with higher specs than my current PC that does a lot of extra things for 1/2 the price and still have enough to buy a decent enough tv to not worry about it. 

You underestimate the value of plug and play devices, too. A console is accessible for a large number of younger people who lack the knowledge or the patience to build a good quality PC with all the bells and whistles needed. It's easy for parents to buy, too - a child could send almost any parent for a PS5 as a birthday gift and they'd come back with a PS5. Give them a shopping list for a high spec PC or the parts and they'd be baffled. 

It's also more accessible in general. Grandma doesn't type, doesn't know how to use the computer that is barely powerful enough to run amazon, and doesn't have internet. What she does have is a TV and the willingness to let her three grandkids come over for the weekend and hook up their console to her tv and let them game for hours. Grandma can even join in - there's less buttons, the joy sticks are intutitve and the device is easy to hold for her arthritic hands. 

&gt; Console has extremly limited modding abilities. Few games on console have mods at all, and if they have the selection is limited compared to PC.

Not everybody wants mods. Some people are purists. 

&gt; There is no hardware advantage in competative multiplayer games. There still is. Different people will use different versions of the console, have different screens with different input lag, have different internet speed. Consoles do even the playing field by a small amount, but we are splitting hairs at this point.

ihwxbp6,abu_hajaaar,"Pitbulls were originally bred for that purpose but that was over 100 years ago at least and have since been bred for house pets and looks for the most part. The pit bulls originally bred are not the same house pets you see today. That being said, I’m not one of those people that say it’s all in the way you raise them and pitbulls aren’t any more dangerous than another large breed. Different breeds have different capabilities and different temperaments and most people who have had dogs their whole lives would agree with that. There’s also a such thing as a bad dog just like there are bad humans but that is rare. There are numerous breeds that don’t make good house pets and are much more aggressive and dangerous than the common pitbull that are not recognized for it because they aren’t common like the pit bull. Many working breeds have demand as house pets so you have dogs like the Belgian Malinois, Caucasian ovcharka, high content wolf dogs, the dogo Argentino being sold as pets which is often a disaster. But others like German shepherds and huskies and pit bulls have been bred as pets for long enough that they have significantly distinguished themselves from the working lineage. 

That being said, I’ve grown up around dogs my entire life including dozens of pitbulls with family and friends and none of them were aggressive. I’ve been taking my dogs to the dog park for 2 decades where there are half a dozen pitbulls and any given time that I’ve never met and none of them have ever been aggressive. But I grew up in a higher income area. I think a lot of the statistics for violence among dogs as well as people are a result of socioeconomic conditions. Also, most pitbulls are pit mixes at best and any time something remotely looks like it has pit in it following an incident is labeled pit bull which skews the statistics a bit and makes it more complicated.

ihy8d4o,poprostumort,"&gt;That being said lets start with money. According to \[this article\](link expunged due to reddit spam filter) a PC with equivalent performance to a PS5 costs 77$ more (I think in practice the difference is a bit larger). But xbox and PS have a fee to play online of 60$ per year.

Let's do the math. MSRP of PS5 is $500. Let's be generous and say that you had to overpay to get your hands on it and pais $600. Online play is $60/year and console generation is 4-6 years long. So maths puts as at total cost over generation at $960. Let's round it up to $1000.

Currently a good $1000 gaming pc would have following specs:  
\- Ryzen 5 5600  
\- 500GB M2 SATA drive  
\- RTX3060  
\- 16GB of RAM

It's power would be comparable to PS5 so it's a tie if we consider current state of things. But when we look from point of view that:

&gt;You will also have to buy a new console every few years if you want to keep up with new game releases, while a PC will be compatible with all games released in the foreseeable future and most games released in the past

We also need to consider how this PC would fare throughout 6 years compared to console. And the answer is unfortunately: poorly.

Console has an advantage that games are directly written to that hardware. More time console has on the market means more experience for devs. And they tend to learn how to push more from the same console. This is not the case for PC. Ports usually don't offer the same level of juicing out components so through time, games will tend to have slowly increasing requirements. For a PC in $1000 price point, it will mean that it will inevitably suffer in performance when comparing the same graphics quality, so you will need to either live with dropping graphics to lower settings or fork out some money for upgrade.

So we have slight win on console side.

&gt;Of course newer games demand more and more performance so in practice you will have to upgrader your PC eventually

So let's consider how it would fare if we would assume upgrade in console budget when new gen hits. Let's look at how $1000 PC from PS4 launch looked:

\- Intel Core i5-4670K  
\- 250GB 3.5 SATA SSD  
\- 8GB of RAM (DDR3 1600 Mhz)  
\- GTX 760 OC

And what can we re-use, what we need to buy. We can stay with this CPU so wea re set with CPU and MoBo. We are definitely need to up RAM to be safe so we need second DDR3 stick, same as currently there  ($50), larger SSD preferably M2 if we have that slot ($60) and new graphics card with power equivalent to 3060 (around $500). so cost of upgrade is already crossing the $600 line and this upgrade will not make this gaming PC live another 6 years, 2-3 at best. After that time you will need to upgrade CPU RAM and MoBo and reuse rest. This would rather eat remaining $400, considering prices of parts.

So it's a tie on money side. But when you compare switching consoles and juggling PC parts to arrange budget well - it's a slight win for console.

&gt;PC has way more games. To such an extent that certain genres of games (are very rare or) dont exist at all on console (rts, moba, indie, gamejam, ect.).

Impossible to compare so it would need to be ignored as it comes down to preferrence. PC has a great backlog of older games, while current consoles have backwards compatibility.

&gt; I would also argue that games are generally cheaper on PC since multiple stores are competing with sales, and because of p\*racy.

And there is no second-hand market which exists on consoles. So it is not really an advantage.

So all in all it would seem that console would win albeit only slightly, right? Well, if you have $1000 budget then yes, it would win only slightly. But if you have $500 budget, it would be a huge win for console as you will still get the same experience with this upfront cost, while it would dramatically slash your PC experience.

And I have been comparing PC to PS5, which is less cost-effective solution. Xbox One X with Gamepass bought on discount would be a steal compared to any $500 PC. I also given PC a headstart by not counting prices of peripherials or system.

And if you have lower budget? sub $400 PC is a piece of crap for gaming. Sub $400 console is a last gen PS4 or current gen Switch/Xbox One S. There is no comparison between gaming experience on those and sub $400 pc.

PC Gaming is superior if you have money for it. For cost-effective gaming, you cannot beat consoles.",7/27/22 21:28,7/27/22 21:28

Like someone else said, when people say that it would be better for someone to remain unborn, they are referring to the potential pain and pleasure that that person would experience throughout their lives, and not to their current state. When the same people advocate for assisted suicide they are also referring to that person's potential for pleasure and pain, and not their current state.

Since the fetus isn't a human yet, we can't apply the same morals we apply to humans, but we can apply the same morals we apply to humans to the future version of the fetus after it's born. If you believe that we should prevent suffering when possible, and there's a high chance that the potential human would suffer immensely after they're born, you might believe that it would be ""better"" for this future person if they were aborted now. This isn't the only conclusion you could reach of course, but it does make sense depending on how you view life and suffering. Notice that with this logic I'm still not applying any morals to the fetus, only to its potential.

For example, let's say you're put in a room with a button in front of you. If you press the button, it will cause an event that will have real consequences on someone else's life for the rest of their life. It could cause them either pain, pleasure, or change nothing, but the chance of it causing pain is a lot higher than the other scenarios, say like 95%. If you have reason to believe this is true, I think most people wouldn't take that chance and would rather not press the button.

ii1dqlg,draculabakula,"&gt;Firstly the entire fascination with “rings” started as a way to discredit the greatness of LeBron James. Nobody would ever say Tony Parker is better than Chris Paul, but he has 4 championships.

Before Lebron ever played basketball there was a debate whether Michael Jordan was the best basketball player ever or not. Before Jordan, Kareem Abdul Jabaar or Wilt Chamberlain were most commonly considered the GOAT. The picture I linked was a reminder that there was a player that had way more rings than any of them."" 

So to say that referencing ""rings"" was started to discredit Lebron is nonsense.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Kobe’s “5 rings” are overrated. He played with a top 10 all time NBA talent Center, in his prime that averaged 35/15 in the finals. He even got a ring averaging 15ppg like a roll player. Kobe is an all time great guard but his Finals performances are looking funny under a microscope 🔬

Overrated how? Yo**u never gave an example of what you are responding to in terms of hw people rate him.** I don't think anybody would ever say he is the best SG of all time but nobody should say he is not it the top 3.

Keep in mind Kobe won two titles without Shaq. Kobe stans like to discredit Pau Gasol but Kobe was still very obviously the leader of that team and the main reason why they won. In 2009 Kobe average 32 pts, 5 rebs, 7 assists in the finals. 

**During the 3 peat, the centers Shaq matched up against in the finals were a washed Rik Smiths in his last season, a 34 year old  Dikembe Mutombo, and Todd Maculloh**. Only Dikembe is a respectable match up and Shaq didn't play as well in that series. He was still great but hopefully you get my point. He wasn't playing peak players. The year before, when the Spurs were healthy, Shaq and Kobe got swept.

**Also, you are doing the same thing to Kobe as what people do to Lebron.** Keep in mind that when Lebron went to the Heat, it wasn't enough for him to be on the same team as a top 5 all time SG and a top 3 at the time PF. They needed to bring in a bunch of more talent to win. When the Cavs beat the Warriors, it is considered the worst officiated series of all time, and when Lebron won in 2020 with the Lakers he greatly benefitted from the shortened season and the bubble.

ii551ed,draculabakula,"My point was that making it so CBs couldn't touch the receiver after 5 years made it much easier for receivers and QBs. Before the rule change every defender was allowed to ""chuck"" (essentially run intoa hard as they wanted without knocking the recurve over) exactly once whilr the receiver was running their route. This meant that a safety could come up with the ball was in the air and hip check the receiver.

You can see how much easier it became to complete passes down field after the changed that. 

In the late 1990s, they made it illegal for players to hand check in the NBA. This made it much easier for small weaker players to score. In the early 2000s they made it illegal for the defender to crowd the shooters landing zone. In the early 2010s they defined the gather step which essentially gave the ball handler an extra step without having to dribble. All these things directly allowed players like Steph Curry and James Harden to be successful. It's safe to say that without those rule changes Steph Curry wouldn't be half the player he is. He would get pushed off balance before his shot, then he would get called for a travel for his double step back three, then he would get injured when he landed on the defender who just walked right into his landing zone.

The dead ball era ended in 1920 when the MLB made it illegal to lick, spit on out Scuff the ball and they made it so the game used multiple balls per game instead of just one. In 1919, the year before the rule change, Babe Ruth broke the record with 29 home runs. The first year of the rule change he hit 54. The year after he hit 59. At the end of the 1930 season,  10 players hit over 35 home runs in a single season.

There's a million things like this.  In 2003 (Lebrons first season) the league changed the playoffs so the first round is now best of 7 instead of best of 5. Before 1983 the first round was best of 3. Some how Lebron owns every playoff total stat category even  though there is are players like Jordan, Kareem, Duncan, and Russell who all had more titles than him. They also changed the way the seeding worked early which made series go longer by having better teams play earlier in the playoffs in Lebrons career and they went from 4 divisions to 6. The last two are obviously minor advantages compared to being guaranteed a minimum of one extra game per year",7/29/22 9:00,7/29/22 9:00

At the same time, most wars are *not* spontaneous combustions of desperate young men attacking one another for resources; they are organized affairs, with leaders at the top who are doing most of the decision making.

These leaders, however, are rarely starving -- having obtained a position of power, it is unlikely that they are desperate in any literal sense.

Not sure if you would prefer to only use insurance price to respond to driving offences, but there are a number of problems using this approach imo:

1. It only really works for people with less income. People with more cash will just be slightly annoyed when the bill arrives..
2. its (usually?) a yearly payment and the price varies due to a huge array of factors. There's little feedback to the driver about the actual cost of the offence, which might have occurred months before.
3. sends a somewhat mixed message imo, that engaging in risky driving can be compensated by paying more. This is true in a financial sense for the insurance company as other customers average out the risk. But the company's financial risk does not directly translate to real world safety.
4. Generally, I think if people are driving on public roads funded by tax dollars, the rest of us should not have to tolerate drivers who disregard the rules.

&amp;#x200B;

Some times the argument it self is the issue.  I could create an entire argument why gynecologists should be allowed to finger bang their patients during exams, but no matter what reasoning I pull out to support that idea the basic idea is that they should be allowed to sexually assault their patients.

&gt;Unwanted pregnancy

Condoms are 98% effective when used properly. Failing that, you can take Plan B. Failing *that*, you can have a first trimester abortion, which is an out-patient procedure. To actually have a child you don't want is insanely difficult. I rather bet on you winning the lottery. There are at least 3 fail safes against it. Condoms are also just one part of it. You can double up by using a condom and IUD if you're really scared.

&gt;STDs can, quite literally, ruin a person's life

What STD ruins a person's life? Syphilis and Chlamydia are minor and treated with a pill that clears them up in a week and then they're forever out of your body.

Herpes has no cure and is life-long, but it's also not a health risk. It's so harmless that doctors don't even check for it when you get a full STD testing done. They recommend against testing for it because the social stigma far outweighs getting three pimples on your genitals for 1 week, every other year. In fact, there's a good chance you already have herpes. 11% of Americans have genital herpes, and about 50% have oral herpes. Herpes is also treatable if you're supremely unlucky and have frequent outbreaks, via a pill.

Even for HIV, only 0.3% of Americans have it, and those that do live lives on par with those who don't via treatment (usually a single pill a day).

It's sad because by far the worst aspects of STDs aren't the diseases themselves, but the social stigma around them. This stigma is often fueled by simple ignorance of STDs.

&gt;i would worry constantly

I've talked about how the risks aren't as risky as I think you're painting them, but we also need to look at the cost of your viewpoint. Denying yourself sex is massive. Abstinence just isn't realistic, does more harm than good, and there's no good reason for it. Sex is amazing and we shouldn't deprive ourselves of something that's safe and natural. Especially since we can do it while taking precautions. Sex releases oxytocin, which builds greater bonds between people. It's extremely difficult to only have a pure friends with benefits. Those sound great, but rarely work out. People can't help but get attached and catch feelings. That's the power of sex, and why should we be denied it until we're in our what, 40s? Most people don't have their career down until mid-life. That seems crazy to me. You don't think so?

You're right there is a risk, but it's absolutely tiny relative to the rewards. We take so many more risks every day. Risking crossing the street. Making an expensive purchase when you could lose your apartment or home to a fire the next day. Choose a college major that turns out to not be your passion. Eat some food that could make you ill via food poisoning or an allergic reaction.

Risks are a part of life and you need to do a smart cost-benefit analysis to decide whether one is worth it. I think 99% of reasonable people would agree sex, when done with just a little care, is worth it.",7/30/22 7:20,7/30/22 7:20

But consider a situation where the two main parties are both bad in that neither want to meaningfully improve the status quo, but also, neither want to make the status quo substantially worse. Further, imagine that the lesser evil party in this case does want some improvements, but they're simply not enough. 


Now imagine there are third parties that do want enough change. In this case, voting for these third parties is actually useful en masse, even though they won't win and will likely be spoilers for the lesser evil.


What can happen is that lesser evil party loses the election, and then realises the demand for third party participation in the democracy. Importantly tho, they also realise that almost all of these third parties are more likely to work with them than with the other major party. So for next election, they make a promise; if we win, we will appoint an election committee that will look into how we can make a fairer democracy that ensures people have local reps, but also allows minority party engagement in democracy. People obviously like this, so they vote for this party next election and they win. This party can now either follow up on their word, or risk never winning an election again for blatantly lying (Justin Trudeau is immune to this because of how terrible Canadian Tories are). So they implement election committee, and bam, now they have MMP instead of FPTP, and there's no single party majority for 20 years


If this sounds oddly specific, it's because it is. It's literally what happened in new Zealand, and it happened because people were willing to vote for not lesser evil.

iiam6q1,zRexxz,"The only reason the third option ""has no chance"" is **because** we choose not to vote for it.

Like, this is the problem with the argument here. People say you shouldn't vote third party because it 'doesn't have a chance' but the only reason it doesn't have a chance is directly **because** of the presumption that they aren't going to win and so no one votes for them.

It's a self-fulfilled prophecy is what I'm saying. It's the very mindset that these parties don't have a chance that **causes** them to not have a chance. We create the lack of chance by choosing not to vote for them in the first place.

If we didn't have that pre-existing belief against third parties and weighed them equally in our options compared to other parties, it's very well possible that they could have much greater of a chance than they currently end up having. But the fact that we assume they have no chance causes their chances to be lesser than if we assume they did have a chance.

So basically, if your argument is: ""third parties don't have a chance"". That's why the solution is **vote for the third party.** Because that's how we increase the chance of the third party winning. I too, believe that third parties ""don't have a chance"", so thus I choose to vote for the third party to increase their chance (albeit slightly, by one vote).

Obviously me voting for the third party alone isn't going to increase its chances far enough to change the tide of the entire election. But I don't blame that on the third party being an ""unviable option"". I blame that on the fact that I'm one of the only few people who seem smart enough to realize the whole ""self-fulfilled prophecy"" that everyone else is getting duped into. If everyone else realized it too, and recognized that it's only our voting patterns and beliefs against third parties that's determining whether the third party has a chance of winning or not, then we could all come to the conclusion ""Hey, technically *any* option has a chance of winning as long as we all vote for it"" and then we all do the smart move which is to vote for the third party and then it actually **does** have a chance of winning. That's really the crux of the problem here.

In short, the ""third parties aren't going to win so why vote for them"" mindset is a logical paradox. We create the problem that we end up criticizing third parties for. We shape the outcomes, we shape the very notion of ""which parties have a chance and which don't"" with our vote.

My mindset when voting is, I'm going to avoid falling in the trap that everyone else falls into. Maybe if enough people catch on, it can spark some kind of gradual shift in how we think about voting. But if you guys want to doom shit by saying ""the third party isn't going to work"", so there's a split vote between the third party and the ""lesser of two evils"" and thus the ""greatest evil"" ends up winning, that's on you guys. It's everyone else's collective stupidity that led to the ""greatest evil"" winning. I'm not going to walk on eggshells by changing my voting patterns to compensate for the fact that everyone else is an idiot when it comes to voting. Imo, it's up to the population to realize this entire thing is simply a consequence of how they choose to vote and their bias against the third party in the first place.

If people really want the ""greatest evil"" not to win the election - the ""lesser two of evils"" logic can apply the opposite way. If people really want to prevent the ""greatest evil"" from winning, they can join me in voting for the third party. I don't get why the sole solution is me changing **my** voting patterns to compensate for everyone else’s stupidity. Everyone else can change their voting patterns to support the third party just as I can change my voting pattern to support the lesser of 2 evils. It's not the ""third party"" that's the problem - it's everyone else's stupidity in thinking that the ""lesser of 2 evils is the only way"" that's the problem.",7/30/22 12:46,7/30/22 12:46

2, Well, no.

1, See? Milk doesn't exist!!!

You see, these two people are talking about the same thing. One just refuses to use the words that society uses because of some personal idea that words should somehow be pure. You are doing exactly the same thing.

&gt;I think society has such rigid standards on what constitutes man or woman / masculinity or femininity, that when someone falls outside of what society defines as being masculine or feminine they may feel compelled to identify as the opposite sex.

Yes, gender is a social construct. 

&gt; This usually leads to the victim developing resentment towards the physical features that are unique to their sex. It makes sense because if they did not have those physical features (in other words, if they were not a member of that sex) then they would be able to express themselves without backlash from society.

And yes, this disconnect between what one ought to identify as and what one does identify as is causing them undue stress and suffering. Nobody is disputing that. The only thing what you and the society disagree at is the label by which you should call these people.

&gt; If people were accepted for who they are they wouldn't feel the need to undergo surgeries and hormone treatments.

Perhaps. Let's grant all of this as true. Let's assume there is no pure bodily dysmorphia involved in regards to trans people. And let's assume the problem is entirely psychological. A combination of social conditioning, trauma, ostracization, etc...

Assuming all of this is true. Does it change anything? Because these people still experience an undue stress and suffering and no other treatment seem to be effective. If the only viable alternative to hormonal therapy, surgery and whatnot is changing the ENTIRETY OF SOCIETY. How could you treat those people, if you prohibit trans care right now? Because even if we assume that we can change the entirety of society, it won't happen overnight. And until then what other option for transgender people is there?

Because like it or not. The current medical intervention is the only effective treatment we have. And yes it relies on changing the people's bodies in a radical way to conform to the narrow categories our society created over it's millennia of existence. And yes, perhaps an androgynous society is both possible and better. But we are not there, are we? And people still experience a very real problem, right?

But if someone is upset and unhappy about something that has happened to them and they are venting by saying ""all men suck!"" listening to them and seeking to understand what they mean when you tell them ""not all men?"" or are you prizing being technically right over their actual need when it makes no difference to you in that moment? 

A lot of this is about *nuance* and *timing*. 'Valid argument' implies that there's a back and forth. Butting into someone else's venting to impose a technicality on them... not so much. Being right is a good thing. Being right *all the time* by forcing yourself into a conversation that didn't need you to invade to correct one small statement when it's highkey unnecessary is borish and rude. 

Edit, since lots of people are taking this to the nth degree because I didn't add any limits on it, which I should have done. That doesn't mean that you should let this stand *forever*. It doesn't mean you shouldn't point out the sexism, or racism, or whatever. But it means you should *pick your time* and consider the situation *before* you make this into a ""you said a bad thing and I'm disappointed in you"" moment. You should consider how close you are with the situation, the person, and whether your contribution will help or whether it will come across as pedantic and dismissive of the actual issue in an effort to be more right than the other person. 

If someone is mad that they just got broken up with and they're losing their home and they're angry and crying about it to their friends and you're just a classmate with no emotional involvement - not a good time to turn this into a teachable moment and you're not benefitting anybody involved here. Save it for later, when the other side is calmer and more open to listening. If they're just complaining about a server who forgot a dish, that's a good time to bring it up and point it out in the moment.  

This is where the *nuance* and the *timing* part comes in. Pick your moment, the way you convey this, and the actual take away you want them to have.

Edit 2: I turned off all inbox replies because wow, there's a lot here. But, long story short, I've made some edits since people don't seem to understand what this means.  

This post *explicitly* responds to the 'not all men' issue, and the fact that OP states it's a *valid and appropriate* response to other people venting about a patriarchy issue involving men. It *explicitly* responds to the argument that saying not all men is more important because being right the highest priority. It challenges the OP by suggesting that it's more important to listen to the issue, the speakers, and the context of the discussion before formulating a response that also challenges the sexism inherent in such statements like ""all men are trash."" 

It is *directly* about producing a conversation that will change people's minds and decrease the likelihood of repeating the behavior rather than making people feel invalidated and like the only thing you care about is being technically right or defending men in a situation where men are the perpetrators of violence, harm, or negative things at the expense of the women involved. 

It is not a defense of bigotry, it is not a 'women can be sexist and men can't' issue (women can be sexist about men) and it's not a 'women can say whatever'. It's not that women must never be challenged quickly and forthrightly about sexism. 

This is where the nuance comes in.

It's about understanding that being right isn't the most important thing in a conversation *in this specific set of circumstances* and if you want to actually challenge sexism, you can't hyperfocus in on a tiny aspect at the expense of everything else in the conversation. 

Intention does a lot of lifting here, *in this specific set of circumstances* on both sides, and if the goal is to challenge sexism, you gotta be willing to open the door and have a conversation, even if you don't like what they say, not roll in with a tired, memed out old line and then get mad when people don't respond to it well.",7/30/22 14:27,7/30/22 14:27
iibco4p,IAteTwoFullHams,"&gt;So Christian faith explicitly states that killing someone is against its rules, if I'm correct it's number 6 on the Christian commandments.

This is not correct.

First of all, the commandments are never actually numbered. Moses says ""Here are the Ten Commandments"" and then he proceeds to say about fifteen different things. Different Christian traditions group them together differently.

But more importantly, Exodus 20:13 does not say ""thou shalt not kill."" Because it's not in English. It says thou shalt not ""retzach.""

What did ""retzach"" mean to Jewish tribesmen living in 950 BCE? It's not actually totally clear. It's used in a variety of ways throughout the Old Testament. And the meanings of words can change drastically within a single generation - I've seen it happen to quite a few words just within my own lifetime.

But there are Biblical scholars who think it's pretty clear that the closest possible translation to ""retzach"" is ""murder."" (Though there are some subtle differences. Like in English, a lion would not murder a deer. But apparently a lion can retzach a deer.)

Because even in the Torah itself, there are commands to kill people. Like Leviticus 20:1-2. ""The Lord said to Moses... any\[one\] in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Molek is to be put to death. The members of the community are to stone him.""

So, are we to believe that God said to Moses: ""People must not kill each other. Also, people must kill anyone who makes a child sacrifice to Molek""?

Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?

But in Leviticus 20, God doesn't use the word ""retzach."" He uses the word ""môt."" Which basically means ""to make dead.""

So apparently you can't retzach, but you can môt. That ought to clear it up, right?",7/30/22 16:06,7/30/22 16:06

iibprjb,Weasel_Cannon,"I think it’s important to understand *why* someone is offended, not just whether they are or not. Let me know what you think of these examples:

“I am offended at your use of the air conditioner” - sounds silly. What if they are offended because they are conscious of the climate and energy usage, and are upset because some people keep the ac on 65 degrees, then wear sweaters and sit under blankets to stay warm. If you’re cold enough to need a sweater and a blanket, then you are wasting energy and harming the environment. Is this person now justified in being offended by air conditioners?

“I am offended by people who eat meat” - nobody wants to hear the vegans shame their eating habits, but in reality many of the sources of our meat are inhumane and filthy. Can we spend more to get “responsible” meat? Sure, but with inflation as it is many people simply do not have this option. Perhaps there is a better way to treat animals and/or our bodies, but is the person justified to be offended that you are directly contributing to the inhumane treatment of animals?

I’m arguing the title of your post, because even if you don’t care as much or at all about the things people are offended by, there is almost always a reason someone feels offended. And, since no one person is the arbiter of “justification”, if someone feels offended then they are absolutely justified in feeling that way. Does it mean they automatically deserve an apology? Not at all. Literally nobody has to care about it. But if they have a reason to feel offended, then they *are* justified in feeling the way they do, no matter how paltry it may seem to you.",7/30/22 17:52,7/30/22 17:52

My only thing is that your examples are those that don’t impact ones life. Or their income. Like for instance, the AC example. That’s something somebody could argue about and their lives just go on to the next day. When someone says they’re offended and feel somebody is transphobic, this is an entire different ball game. You’re now in the realm of potentially taking food off of ones table. Stripping away opportunities that one may have worked all of their life for. This is where I feel it’s wrong and there needs to be something that addresses the offended party. Now if what offended somebody is something that’s clearly wrong, then yeah they should get what’s coming for them. But if it’s just something like a joke that can be views similar to the vegan example you gave, why should one have to suffer just because of a simple difference in opinion?

So just to be clear, despite Rome and Greece directly disproving your position, you're claiming that the Church stopped the powerful from practicing polygamy, though they could still practice adultery and maintain multiple mistresses, and that's somehow proof of anything? 

&gt;Not sure what you mean by ""You ever been to France"".

There's this thing with French people and mistresses. 

&gt; They had adultery, not polygamy. 

Yep. 

&gt;And that is from where the Catholic Church drew its stand on monogamy. 

No, the Catholic church drew its opposition to adultery from the 7th commandment. Which by the way was revealed to Moses in Eurasia, not Europe. 

&gt; I'm sure you know that Catholic Church came into existence in ancient Rome, and after the fall of western Rome, when most of Europe returned to a clan way of living, the church still maintained the policy of monogamy and later spread it to the rest of western Europe.

So the Catholic church spread the teachings of a Semitic religion which spawned in Eurasia to Europe and you think this is evidence that Europe created the concept of monogamy and therefore only European societies can handle democracy?",7/30/22 19:03,7/30/22 19:03

iicuejx,PreacherJudge,"&gt; With AI art and AI scriptwriting like DALLE and AI dungeon, proof that AI can already construct art just as well, if not better than humans, there is no reason for a company to hire a worker over a machine.

This is obviously untrue.

What I think you mean to say here is that these tools suggest that at some point in the future, AI will be able to make art as well as humans do.  I'm concerned here, though, because it's very hard for non-experts to talk about hypothetical future technology that might not ever exist.

You are also ignoring that the fun of things like DALLE and AI dungeon is that they're in the uncanny valley, which is what makes them weird and funny.  They're close enough to what a human would make, but they're also extremely stupid and they swerve in unexpected ways.  VERY few people go to them for anything but amusement.

&gt; No one will go through the trouble of hiring a graphic designer or artist when AI can instantly generate pictures, concept art, game portraits or scripts for movies.

You're not appreciating the tradeoff of randomness and coherence.  To an AI, creativity is just randomness, and because of that, it's very hard to get them to be creative in a way that makes any sense.  Human curation helps some, but that brings in its own problems: the rules of creativity being *crowdsourced* will pretty much by definition keep creativity from being anything at all.

I can see AI being used to replace illustration jobs for articles. But a lot of places that would do this are already going to just use stock photography. 

AI can do early concept art, but at a certain point concept art needs to be refined so that it can be actually built, and AI software can’t do any of those final steps. Maybe there will be fewer concept art jobs because this software makes it much faster to make concept art. But… a bulk of a production studio isn’t concept artists. 

House of Cards was not written by AI, it was written by people. But decisions early on in its process were made by AI, like choosing a star and choosing a director. This isn’t replacing artists, its making decisions that executives make. 

And a problem with AI writing so far is it doesn’t understand things like subtext, metaphor, or symbolism. I also think this stuff is bad at writing really long form stories that are coherent.

I don't really understand how these describe a conflict.

In fact, teaching men to express their sexuality and aggression in healthier and more respectful ways is exactly the kind of thing people are talking about when they say they want to teach men to be more expressive.

As for reinforcing behaviours, it’s all about what society deems permissible and impermissible.

This is the key line.

If Sharon didn't have to worry about retaliation, or ""why are you making such a big thing of this"", this would be less of an issue. But her boss has direct power over her career and her financial security. Even if this were a co-worker, it'd be a bit problematic, but it's *much* more so when there's a power asymmetry: Sharon's boss is - whether he means to or not - applying pressure to Sharon to accept or at least not reject his advances for fear of repercussions.

The problem isn't Sharon's boss expressing something. The problem is the power dynamic.

&gt; Sharon instead goes to HR and reports her boss for sexual harassment (I am not sure if this is even possible, and if not maybe you can enlighten me) despite the fact that she never made it clear where she stands.

Sharon shouldn't have to ""make it clear where she stands"", because any manager worth their salt should know this creates a bad power dynamic that both (a) is a terrible way to run a workplace and (b) opens you up to legal action. Were HR aware of this behavior, they would put a stop to it with or without a complaint (at least if they're remotely doing their jobs).

Expression *in the workplace* is generally subordinate to maintaining the working relationships within it. I have co-workers that I do not like and that I would very much like to tell to shut up once in a while. I don't do that, though, because a workplace relationship necessarily has different dynamics from a private relationship in that we're all trapped in the same room together five days a week.

&gt; Let's say Billy goes to a party and attempts to hit on a very attractive girl. That girl, not finding Billy attractive in the slightest, scoffs and turns her back on him, giggling with her friends. Billy gets angry and says that she should at least give him a chance.

Billy has gotten a pretty clear ""no"". Admittedly a kind of mean one, maybe meaner than necessary, but it's a ""no"". Pushing when you have gotten a ""no"" isn't expression, it's insistence.

&gt; A proper response to this expression of sexual attraction may better have been ""sorry, I'm just not interested"" or ""not looking for anything tonight.""

Sure, the object of Billy's attraction here was pretty mean to him. But that doesn't absolve Billy himself of pushing after he got a ""no"".",7/31/22 13:02,7/31/22 13:02
iif6zi3,barbodelli,"Tazers are only about 60% effective. You ever seen those police shootings. A lot of the times they are shooting because multiple tazers didn't work.

There's a lot of things that have to come together for a tazer to work.

Guns are just better. 

Also I would argue pepper spray is a better alternative than tazers. It's impossible to aim once you've been hit in the face with pepper spray. They will just be shooting the air. Pepper spray has a much better % of effectiveness if you hit the target. Neither of course can compete with a gun.",7/31/22 13:03,7/31/22 13:03
iif7u1x,I_am_the_night,"So, I wonder if you would feel the same way about literally every partisan issue. Like, imagine making the argument you are making, but instead imagine that the issue at stake isn't abortion, but slavery. I'm not saying the ends justify the means or anything like that, it's just odd to suggest that there is a level of partisanship that is unacceptable regardless of what the goal of that partisan effort is.

Would you support expanding the court if it meant overturning chattel slavery?",7/31/22 13:09,7/31/22 13:09
iifrru3,MrReyneCloud,"All lyrics have ambiguity.

Its obvious the character in the song wants to better understand thier lover.

My personal interpretation of the first line is “It doesn’t hurt me….” …to tell me what you truly think/feel.

Why is it so hard to communicate this with each other? Its the barriers between us.

If only we could swap places and actually feel how each other does, we would ynderstand in a way beyond words.

Alternatives are certainly possible. Like her saying “it doesn’t hurt me” is one of the lies couples tell each other, a miscommunication to avoid conflict.",7/31/22 15:34,7/31/22 15:34
